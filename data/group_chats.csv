"10/05/2021, 16:44",Gita,No
"10/05/2021, 17:13",Gita,While doing assignment.. I see lot of code in internet as in our assignment.. We will use that r we have to do completely new code???
"10/05/2021, 17:25",Nagaraju,If you use code from internet you need to cite its source
"10/05/2021, 17:26",Nav,"Even if you're copying the code, mention it's source and understand the logic. Blindly copying the code won't help at all"
"10/05/2021, 17:27",Nagaraju,If you copy code from someone's github then they will mark it as plagiarized
"10/05/2021, 17:28",Nagaraju,So be careful
"10/05/2021, 17:57",Gita,Oh k thank u

"11/05/2021, 20:03",Nagaraju,I noticed that feature importance may slightly vary if you use different parameters in your learning model
"11/05/2021, 20:07",Sherya,Thankyou :)
"11/05/2021, 20:09",Sherya,Here your y axis is the absolute difference in weights right?
"11/05/2021, 20:31",Nagaraju,Ye
"11/05/2021, 20:31",Sherya,Cool
"13/05/2021, 02:50",Nagaraju,Have any of you completed FB case study assignment?

"13/05/2021, 16:41",Gita,i hvae not defined any thing
"13/05/2021, 16:41",Nagaraju,Restart your kernel and try
"13/05/2021, 16:41",Gita,ok
"13/05/2021, 16:42",Nagaraju,It would have stored your function
"13/05/2021, 16:42",Gita,after kernal refeshment i got it thank you

"14/05/2021, 17:28",Murat,Does AAIC have a mobile app?
"14/05/2021, 17:41",Namita,Do AAIC have app🤔
"14/05/2021, 17:45",Himanshu,No..I guess
"14/05/2021, 19:52",Raju,But the website does work on mobile fairly well
"14/05/2021, 19:54",Rohit,"No, it shows lag when video played at 1.5/2x speed"
"14/05/2021, 20:17",Param,i have completed 2 modules in 45 days ...am i going slow?
"14/05/2021, 20:17",Param,😥
"14/05/2021, 20:29",Sherya,First 2 modules were easy. Next modules will be tougher and you will have to work extra hours every day
"14/05/2021, 20:31",Param,sure
"15/05/2021, 09:54",Silam,I have gone through this document found
"15/05/2021, 09:54",Silam,But its plane stochastic gradient
"15/05/2021, 09:55",Silam,Hello any one know how to use logistic regression with optimization stochastic gradient descent
"15/05/2021, 09:58",Silam,Or SGDClassifier(loss='log') results in logistic regression
"15/05/2021, 09:58",Shyam,Make loss='log'
"15/05/2021, 09:58",Raghvendra,Yes
"15/05/2021, 09:59",Silam,Its mean after changing log loss its become logstic regession?
"15/05/2021, 09:59",Shyam,Yes
"15/05/2021, 09:59",Raghvendra,Correct
"15/05/2021, 10:00",Shyam,<Media omitted>
"15/05/2021, 10:00",Silam,Okay if we will take hing it will consider as svm with sgdclassifier
"15/05/2021, 10:01",Shyam,Yes
"15/05/2021, 10:01",Silam,Okay thanx nimisha

"15/05/2021, 13:34",Om,ohh...my bad.. didn't really consider it...
"15/05/2021, 13:34",Nagaraju,No problem
"15/05/2021, 13:57",Dil,Started after long time
"15/05/2021, 13:57",Dil,Daily3hrs target

"15/05/2021, 15:59",Nagaraju,We cannot help if you don't show your code😅
"15/05/2021, 16:00",Abhimanyu,<Media omitted>
"15/05/2021, 16:04",Nagaraju,If key exists you need to use the current value and update it right?
"15/05/2021, 16:22",Aadesh,It would not be same
"15/05/2021, 17:08",Raghvendra,<Media omitted>
"15/05/2021, 17:27",Suyash,<Media omitted>
"15/05/2021, 17:28",Suyash,Can someone tell me what's wrong with the code ?
"15/05/2021, 18:18",Aadesh,Once Google the error. You might get close to the solution..
"15/05/2021, 18:19",Suyash,It is working with np.hstack but not scipy
"15/05/2021, 18:50",Aadesh,"In assignment 8E,"
"15/05/2021, 18:53",Sherya,xq should come from X_cv and xi should be your support vector
"15/05/2021, 18:53",Nitya,Apply np.reshape() first and then apply hstack
"15/05/2021, 18:54",Aadesh,Then alpha values=dual_coef_?
"15/05/2021, 18:54",Sherya,Yup
"15/05/2021, 18:54",Sherya,dual_coef_ = alphai * yi
"15/05/2021, 18:55",Aadesh,Okay.. let me try and work it out.. thanks!
"15/05/2021, 18:55",Aadesh,This will be computed  inside the decision function
"15/05/2021, 18:55",Aadesh,Along with kernel
"15/05/2021, 18:56",Sherya,"xq is your query point(should come from CV set), to compute output for xq you use sum(alphai*yi*k(xi,xq))"
"15/05/2021, 18:57",Sherya,alphai is zero for all non support vectors
"15/05/2021, 18:57",Sherya,I hope this helps
"15/05/2021, 18:58",Aadesh,Yes... Very helpful 👍
"15/05/2021, 19:01",Sherya,Cool

"16/05/2021, 19:38",Krishan,Hello Folks
"16/05/2021, 19:39",Nagaraju,For assignment you need to continue with featurized data set
"16/05/2021, 19:40",Nagaraju,It's just 2 features you need to add
"16/05/2021, 19:40",Nagaraju,Check the notebook once
"16/05/2021, 19:42",Krishan,"Oh, I was trying with whole dataset by doing featurization without skipping any records."
"16/05/2021, 19:43",Krishan,Thanks!👍
"16/05/2021, 19:45",Gita,"Age, operation year, axil nodes, status"
"16/05/2021, 19:45",Abhi,Got them tq
"16/05/2021, 20:01",Nagaraju,Yeah this will take too much time
"16/05/2021, 20:18",Krishan,👍
"16/05/2021, 20:40",Simran,Can we complete complete microsoft malware detection assignment in colaab?
"16/05/2021, 20:41",Simran,Google colab?

"17/05/2021, 14:55",Namita,Sort descending order slice till 50th index
"17/05/2021, 14:58",Rohan,"Okay but don't you think many solutions are possible, does it even matter if I randomly select any 50 of it"
"17/05/2021, 14:58",Raghvendra,In assignment 8E when I compute the decision function the values are different from the actual one as shown in screenshot .please help.

"17/05/2021, 15:00",Namita,I guess they won't accept if you pick random 50
"17/05/2021, 15:01",Rohan,Okay thanks I will submit it that way then..😂
"17/05/2021, 15:08",Krishan,Hello Folks!
"17/05/2021, 15:13",Aadesh,How many values are 1 and how many are 0?
"17/05/2021, 15:17",Sherya,You have to find the output for all values of xq right? Then why are you indexing the first 10 values of Xcv?
"17/05/2021, 15:27",Raghvendra,My logic is failing somewhere so I am all as 1 's
"17/05/2021, 15:29",Raghvendra,for testing purpose I have taken only few points.
"17/05/2021, 15:32",Raghvendra,"Actually  I need to perform summation of alpha values and summation support vectors  for calculating the query point so I, missing  at that point."
"17/05/2021, 17:18",Dil,Anybody is working professional are there
"17/05/2021, 17:18",Dil,How u guys managing time
"17/05/2021, 17:25",Nitya,Yupe
"17/05/2021, 17:25",Nitya,Literally tough to manage time
"17/05/2021, 17:26",Murat,Yes tough to manage time
"17/05/2021, 17:29",Simran,It's not easy
"17/05/2021, 17:41",Raghvendra,I am also finding difficult  to manage
"17/05/2021, 17:59",Vandana,Yes exactly. I try to give 1 hr atleast daily. But feels like that wouldn't be enough
"17/05/2021, 18:01",Krishan,Yes Guys.
"17/05/2021, 18:02",Nitya,Not completed the entire course
"17/05/2021, 18:06",Murat,1 hour is only sufficient for the video lectures. Assignments need lot of time
"17/05/2021, 18:06",Nitya,How many assignment completed?
"17/05/2021, 18:07",Kirti,It literally takingbl hours
"17/05/2021, 18:09",Nagaraju,Anyone started DL assignments?
"17/05/2021, 18:09",Kirti,Just mandatory first 4 completed
"17/05/2021, 18:13",Nagaraju,Good
"17/05/2021, 18:14",Nitya,Yupe assignments are lengthy
"17/05/2021, 18:14",Murat,Only 1 assignment so far
"17/05/2021, 18:15",Kirti,One of my experienced shared that....In beginning it takes time to solve..later we can solve easily
"17/05/2021, 18:16",Kirti,Just a little hope
"17/05/2021, 18:34",Namita,No bro deep learning takes lot of time
"17/05/2021, 18:35",Kirti,"Really, m not there.."
"17/05/2021, 18:35",Namita,Yup just to train the models takes decades 😂
"17/05/2021, 18:36",Kirti,😂
"17/05/2021, 18:40",Priyanka,😂😂
"17/05/2021, 18:43",Nagaraju,You guys use colab or kaggle?
"17/05/2021, 18:43",Nagaraju,The first two assignments-
"17/05/2021, 18:44",Nagaraju,I wanted to complete them soon so I can get the first case study🙈
"17/05/2021, 18:44",Nagaraju,Any one did them
"17/05/2021, 18:44",Nagaraju,?
"17/05/2021, 18:54",Nitya,Backpropagation n callbacks doesn't take much time to train
"17/05/2021, 18:55",Krishan,How is kaggle?
"17/05/2021, 18:57",Nagaraju,I have only tried colab
"17/05/2021, 18:58",Nitya,Does GCP free version work for 3 months only ?
"17/05/2021, 18:59",Naveen,I think it provides you free usage for 300 $ worth  after that you need to pay
"17/05/2021, 19:01",Nitya,I guess either 300$ or 3 months
"17/05/2021, 19:03",Naveen,Yeah yeah
"17/05/2021, 19:22",Simran,Is it easy to configure gcp?
"17/05/2021, 19:23",Krishan,Yes. GCP provides free access for 3months with $300 credits on your account.
"17/05/2021, 19:24",Nitya,"Don’t worry guyz , as we progress ahead and we have developed the habit , it will not take that much time"
"17/05/2021, 19:24",Krishan,👍
"17/05/2021, 19:24",Simran,"Without GPU, deep learning takes lot of time"
"17/05/2021, 19:25",Sanjana,"Hi guys,one clarification ...are u guys following a method of going through the comments after each videos..as it take lot of time to go through...how important is that  or what's the best practice?"
"17/05/2021, 19:26",Nitya,The best practice that I do is to just check the top comment that most votes and then check some of its thread comments
"17/05/2021, 19:26",Murat,No there are 300 plus comments after each video. Just follow the first few maybe first 10 to 30 comments
"17/05/2021, 19:27",Kirti,Even though it  takes time. It's worthy
"17/05/2021, 19:27",Naveen,Just check if there is any edit for video from applied AI side . That's the only thing you need . If you feel you didn't understand something in video then go for comments and check if anyone has raised same question.
"17/05/2021, 19:27",Kirti,Some explain the topic more easier than in video
"17/05/2021, 19:27",Krishan,Where can we get GPUs?
"17/05/2021, 19:27",Krishan,In any online tool?
"17/05/2021, 19:28",Kirti,Hey guys I have the total course pdf.... Do u guys need?
"17/05/2021, 19:28",Naveen,It's available in website itself right
"17/05/2021, 19:29",Sanjana,Can you pls share
"17/05/2021, 19:30",Rohit,Please share
"17/05/2021, 19:31",Rohit,yes
"17/05/2021, 19:31",Simran,"In Google colab , we can use GPUs to perform our tasks"
"17/05/2021, 19:31",Simran,Sure👍

"17/05/2021, 19:50",Kirti,"Hey guys, no mention ❤️"
"17/05/2021, 19:52",Sherya,Ask for a schedule from AAIC and try to compete with the schedule and stay ahead of it. Complete the first 3 modules quickly atleast 1 month before schedule they are the easiest. Doing this will buy you extra time to solve lengthy assignments.
"17/05/2021, 19:53",Anushka,Thanks bro👍🏻
"17/05/2021, 19:54",Virat,I have also completed module 1 and module 2 in 2weeks...
"17/05/2021, 19:56",Sherya,Good job bro. Try to be consistent. I was in a similar situation like you but I lost consistency and I am currently lagging behind the schedule by 50 days.
"17/05/2021, 19:58",Virat,Hoping to not loss consistency...
"17/05/2021, 20:04",Dil,Mee too
"17/05/2021, 20:05",Simran,I suggest to read this small good book on developing habits -  *Atomic Habits by James Clear*
"17/05/2021, 20:10",Dil,What is step size=1 in SGD assignment?
"17/05/2021, 20:11",Virat,<Media omitted>
"17/05/2021, 20:11",Virat,Are you trying to say this book as I have send pdf in the group 👆🏻👆🏻@919900888116
"17/05/2021, 20:13",Simran,Yes. This is the book👍👌👌
"17/05/2021, 20:13",Virat,Okk... Will surely go through it...
"17/05/2021, 20:16",Prajwal,Thanks for sharing. This is a very good book
"17/05/2021, 20:26",Virat,👍👍
"17/05/2021, 21:46",Param,many many thanks dude🙀🙏🏻
"17/05/2021, 22:07",Raju,Thanks man literally half of the time was going into making notes
"17/05/2021, 22:16",Priya,"Thanks, mate and big thanks to the person who put in the hard work. 🙏"
"17/05/2021, 22:17",Aadesh,Thankyou

"18/05/2021, 08:34",Shruti,"Hello ,have anyone done "" recomendation system assignment"" ,how to solve last part of predicting ratings and finding rmse ,can some one share screenshot?"
"18/05/2021, 09:32",Priyanka,"I know every one having different roles here, some are students some working professionals, everyone having different pace of study and schedules, but what is common amongst us is finish this course efficiently and get some fruit out of it. Seeing the helps/suggestions/feedbacks from every members, It looks like purpose of this group is being served diligently. Thanks guys, it is really appreciable. Keep this flow going...🙏"
"18/05/2021, 10:00",Siddhesh,@919652638618 hi...
"18/05/2021, 10:01",Priyanka,Name written on the pdf
"18/05/2021, 10:01",Siddhesh,Okay
"18/05/2021, 10:02",Siddhesh,Karthik...
"18/05/2021, 10:04",Siddhesh,@919652638618
"18/05/2021, 10:04",Priyanka,This pdf was also appreciated Srikant  sir in his lecture videos
"18/05/2021, 10:05",Siddhesh,Oh... really...
"18/05/2021, 10:05",Priyanka,I don't remember exactly
"18/05/2021, 10:05",Priyanka,But it was in module 1
"18/05/2021, 10:05",Siddhesh,Ok...
"18/05/2021, 10:05",Siddhesh,Grt.. thanks
"18/05/2021, 10:06",Priyanka,In starting lectures i guess
"18/05/2021, 10:52",Nagaraju,Just build a simple model using those features to predict ratings
"18/05/2021, 10:52",Nagaraju,And show the rmse
"18/05/2021, 10:58",Shruti,I am getting errors can share screenshot or code?
"18/05/2021, 10:59",Nagaraju,I'll send it in a while
"18/05/2021, 11:00",Shruti,K
"18/05/2021, 11:03",Simran,Thank you very much Nithish
"18/05/2021, 15:09",Dil,https://link.medium.com/iDx1bYb8lgb
"18/05/2021, 18:49",Dil,"In SGD problem,I am getting predicted probability as 1 for one of the example,because of this logloss is failung simce log(1-1) is zero.haa any one faced this issue?"
"18/05/2021, 18:50",Priti,log(0) is not zero. It is -inf
"18/05/2021, 18:50",Dil,I mean it is failing for log(0)
"18/05/2021, 18:51",Dil,Since it is not defined
"18/05/2021, 18:52",Dil,"I am planning to replace predictions 0 and 1 with some other values like close to 0 and 1,Is it the right approach?"
"18/05/2021, 18:52",Priti,sounds right
"18/05/2021, 18:53",Dil,No one faced thisissue in SGD?
"18/05/2021, 18:54",Pranjal,I am also facing
"18/05/2021, 18:54",Pranjal,The same issue
"18/05/2021, 18:54",Pranjal,Fir me values are turning to nan
"18/05/2021, 22:03",Namita,Do anyone have idea about how to read 8GB csv file efficiently in less time?
"18/05/2021, 22:04",Aadesh,Use wget command
"18/05/2021, 22:04",Aadesh,It'll take pretty much less time compared to other methods
"18/05/2021, 22:04",Nav,Don't upload the dataset on your jupyter notebook
"18/05/2021, 22:04",Nav,Use wget yeah
"18/05/2021, 22:05",Nav,Curlwget
"18/05/2021, 22:05",Nav,You can find the tutorial on youtube
"18/05/2021, 22:05",Namita,The file is in my local system not on cloud so v can't go for curlwget
"18/05/2021, 22:07",Murat,Doesn't Google colab allow that much data?
"18/05/2021, 22:08",Murat,It  has around 15gb I guess for each account
"18/05/2021, 22:08",Nav,Have you tried using Dask?
"18/05/2021, 22:09",Nav,Still it would take time to load 8 gb
"18/05/2021, 22:09",Krishan,You could try on GCP.
"18/05/2021, 22:10",Murat,What is the volume of the data? I mean no.of records?
"18/05/2021, 22:10",Namita,around 3million rows
"18/05/2021, 22:10",Murat,Maybe you can put it on some columnar database
"18/05/2021, 22:11",Murat,Teradata
"18/05/2021, 22:11",Murat,Or something like that
"18/05/2021, 22:12",Pranjal,Try using simple with open
"18/05/2021, 22:12",Priya,Don't use pandas it will consume your RAM....instead write a script to read line by line using CSV module
"18/05/2021, 22:12",Murat,If you can split the data and populate as seperate tables and then use it with joins as per your requirement. More like an ETL
"18/05/2021, 22:13",Murat,Will clean unnecessary if any to certain extent
"18/05/2021, 22:13",Murat,But it's time consuming
"18/05/2021, 22:13",Simran,"If the data is in Google drive, use !gdown command in colab"
"18/05/2021, 22:13",Simran,It's very fast
"18/05/2021, 22:14",Namita,yeah problem is its in local system i am searching for a option not use cloud
"18/05/2021, 22:14",Simran,Ok
"18/05/2021, 22:16",Murat,Usually in companies 3 million records are easily handled in databases but you need to have enough disk space also
"18/05/2021, 22:17",Murat,That's why suggested database
"18/05/2021, 22:19",Namita,Yup trying for to create data base thx for responsponding
"18/05/2021, 22:23",Murat,Use a columnar database that will be extremely fast
"18/05/2021, 22:24",Murat,Because it will populate data column wise and throws the query results in seconds
"18/05/2021, 23:02",Namita,Found solution dask library worked
"19/05/2021, 11:48",Ankit,Hey guys
"19/05/2021, 19:12",Ashish,Hi guys. Is anyone working on Assignment 9 - DT on Donors Dataset. Is the 3d plot visible after executing the code in the given file -  3d_scatter_plot.ipynb?
"19/05/2021, 19:13",Namita,Check for magic line
"19/05/2021, 19:16",Ashish,I have added the
"19/05/2021, 19:17",Pranjal,You have to add a function which contains jsn
"19/05/2021, 19:17",Pranjal,*js
"19/05/2021, 19:17",Pranjal,Just google you will found the function
"19/05/2021, 19:19",Ashish,Okay. Thank you :)
"19/05/2021, 19:20",Sandesh,Or you can just use the confusion matrix. It was either a 3d plot or confusion matrix if I remember correctly ?
"19/05/2021, 19:21",Ashish,"Yes, it was either. I wanted to try out the 3d plot."
"19/05/2021, 19:21",Ashish,Thank you
"19/05/2021, 19:47",Suyash,Did it work ?
"19/05/2021, 19:47",Suyash,Please mention the code you've written to work . It didn't work for me either
"19/05/2021, 20:19",Ashish,"I am trying it out. Not sure if its because I am using google colab. If I get it, I will let you know"
"19/05/2021, 20:22",Suyash,Sure
"19/05/2021, 20:40",Pranjal,Try it out ... When you're done and if didn't worked out.. msg me I will help you... But first try it out yourself
"19/05/2021, 20:41",Ashish,"Sure, I will try it out. If I still don't get it, I'll approach you for help/guidance."
"19/05/2021, 20:41",Pranjal,Okay
"19/05/2021, 20:59",Aadesh,I tried using 3d plot.
"19/05/2021, 21:01",Ashish,Ooh okay
"19/05/2021, 21:10",Nagaraju,Anyone who's done backprop assignment
"19/05/2021, 21:10",Nagaraju,<Media omitted>
"19/05/2021, 21:11",Nagaraju,My grader is not passing because of one number being different
"19/05/2021, 21:11",Nagaraju,What can i do?
"19/05/2021, 21:42",Dil,When u started applied ai
"19/05/2021, 22:36",Nitya,U can modify value of grader function beyond  6 decimal point
"19/05/2021, 22:36",Nagaraju,Team won't say anythin?
"19/05/2021, 22:37",Nitya,I asked them for the same..they told me the solution
"19/05/2021, 22:38",Nitya,<Media omitted>

"20/05/2021, 19:20",Nagaraju,Anyone completed malware assignment?
"20/05/2021, 20:01",Ranjit,This message was deleted
"20/05/2021, 20:01",Ranjit,+1
"20/05/2021, 20:01",Namita,i had done
"20/05/2021, 20:02",Namita,but on a local system
"20/05/2021, 20:16",Krishan,You were able to do featurization for bigram on byte files on local?
"20/05/2021, 20:17",Namita,6 hours 16GB ram i7 processor 1TB hard disk
"20/05/2021, 20:18",Sandesh,I am trying the malware detection as well. When trying to convert from .bytes to .txt it gets stuck and it says permission denied. Is anyone fscing this issue ?
"20/05/2021, 20:18",Nagaraju,Woah
"20/05/2021, 20:19",Krishan,Nice👍
"20/05/2021, 20:19",Nagaraju,But how tough is the assignment itself
"20/05/2021, 20:20",Namita,Computation is time consuming
"20/05/2021, 20:20",Krishan,"Yes. Actually, it is time consuming."
"20/05/2021, 20:21",Prajwal,My personal suggestion is to do malware assignment at the last..While doing that assignment I lost my consistency and get lost of frustration because of run time crashes..

"20/05/2021, 20:22",Namita,These are stats of tuffness
"20/05/2021, 20:22",Krishan,👍
"20/05/2021, 20:22",Krishan,👍
"20/05/2021, 20:23",Nagaraju,I think i will take this advice
"20/05/2021, 20:23",Nagaraju,Lots of people on slack also have problems with this one assignment!
"20/05/2021, 20:23",Namita,Keep that assignment at last if you at middle of course u vl get demotivated
"20/05/2021, 20:24",Priyanka,239 gb😳
"20/05/2021, 20:24",Namita,😂🙏
"20/05/2021, 20:24",Namita,Imagine of training the model on this data
"20/05/2021, 20:24",Prajwal,And for mock interview and case study also they will give exception for this..we need 15 assignments only..I get completed the case study and mock and still Not completed Microsoft..But I will do after completing all assignments and remaining self Casestudy
"20/05/2021, 20:25",Sherya,If it takes 6hrs to run the code then how is it possible to complete this in Google colab?
"20/05/2021, 20:25",Prajwal,Yes teja..what you said is right..I remembered those days
"20/05/2021, 20:25",Namita,Colab doesn't work go for GCP if u have strong internet
"20/05/2021, 20:26",Namita,Or else prefer local system if it can meet requirments
"20/05/2021, 20:26",Sherya,I have 4 gb ram 😅
"20/05/2021, 20:26",Namita,Go for gcp if u have credit card
"20/05/2021, 20:27",Prajwal,Use GCP if possible for you or else 25 GB ram notebook provided in that assignment itself for doing computations and need to do but of engineering here like taking features in batch wise and storing parallely
"20/05/2021, 20:27",Sandesh,It would have been better if this data would have been hosted somewhere and we could just stream the data. With this I am stuck at one point with permission denied and am not able to proceed further
"20/05/2021, 20:33",Namita,My suggestion is Better try this assignment after doing deep learning bcoz in DL assignments r more tuff and time consuming after doing those assignments u vl feel this a bit easy
"20/05/2021, 20:39",Krishan,"For the Clustering Assignment, can anyone share what best n_clusters they were getting?"
"20/05/2021, 20:40",Nagaraju,Which DL assignments are easy.
"20/05/2021, 20:41",Namita,"Apart from NLP attention mechanism,  image segmentation remaing are easy these two are super tuff"
"20/05/2021, 20:45",Namita,But as course progress on u vl understand the level of tuffness
"20/05/2021, 21:09",Prajwal,Nice suggestion teja..I too thinking to say this only..
"20/05/2021, 21:09",Nagaraju,Thanks a lot!!
"20/05/2021, 21:15",Naveen,Hey
"20/05/2021, 21:15",Naveen,You can use your GPU if you have it right
"20/05/2021, 21:18",Namita,No idea I guess v can access gpu only for deep learning that too nvedia but not sure
"20/05/2021, 21:22",Naveen,Yeah I use it for  deep learning models. For ml based models also you can change your training mode by tweaking code.
"20/05/2021, 21:24",Naveen,You need CUDA for nvidia
"20/05/2021, 21:24",Namita,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41567895/will-scikit-learn-utilize-gpu

"21/05/2021, 01:13",Sherya,But they have asked to encode project_title in Assignment 11: Apply GBDT. What to do?
"21/05/2021, 01:14",Sherya,"If any one has solved Assignment 11, please help 🙏🏾"
"21/05/2021, 05:38",Simran,We can ignore project title
"21/05/2021, 08:24",Aadesh,Ignore it
"21/05/2021, 08:24",Aadesh,I mean do univariate analysis.. if you feel it is important then include it.
"21/05/2021, 08:50",Dil,After completing one topic you are going for assignments
"21/05/2021, 08:58",Suyash,Guyz suggest on which application should we solve malware detection and what are the best ways for training it faster .. I've 8 gb ram ryzen 5..
"21/05/2021, 09:37",Sherya,Cool
"21/05/2021, 09:37",Sherya,Okay
"21/05/2021, 09:38",Sherya,I am going as per schedule but any ways I am lagging behind by atleast 50 days I 😭
"21/05/2021, 09:40",Nagaraju,That schedule is messed up
"21/05/2021, 09:40",Nagaraju,I don't think anyone would be able to do that
"21/05/2021, 09:42",Param,😂😂
"21/05/2021, 09:43",Murat,Agreed. It gave me so many videos to cover in a single day which is impossible
"21/05/2021, 09:43",Sherya,Agreed 😂
"21/05/2021, 09:46",Nagaraju,According to the schedule I should have completed the course by now.
"21/05/2021, 09:47",Nagaraju,<Media omitted>
"21/05/2021, 09:49",Nagaraju,"Yeah, there's only so much information you can retain in one day."
"21/05/2021, 09:50",Priyanka,💯 agreed😂😂
"21/05/2021, 10:08",Aadesh,"In 8F assignment,  the sigmoid function is different. Do I need to compute dw and db by differentiating it or can I use dw and db from SGD assignment itself"
"21/05/2021, 10:08",Naveen,Yeah 😂😂 it's like if you mention that you can work for 3 hours a day. It will include all videos duration summing up to 3hrs and assignment if any in that chapter so weird😅
"21/05/2021, 10:26",Nagaraju,They should use some ai based scheduling😂
"21/05/2021, 10:39",Murat,If you give one half hour of time per day because of work and the schedule that they send requires 3 to 4 hours atleast.
"21/05/2021, 10:41",Nagaraju,Some times you need to rewatch a section as well
"21/05/2021, 10:42",Murat,Yes. Some math needs to be revisited
"21/05/2021, 10:42",Anmol,Making individual notes is another task altogether
"21/05/2021, 10:42",Naveen,Funniest part is they allocate 30 mins for entire chapter or interview question 😂😂
"21/05/2021, 10:44",Nagaraju,"Srikanth sir always says ""tons of students complete our course"""
"21/05/2021, 10:44",Nagaraju,That*
"21/05/2021, 10:45",Anmol,Many people complete but Oly some do all assignments
"21/05/2021, 10:45",Nagaraju,Content you can complete
"21/05/2021, 10:45",Nagaraju,Assignments and case studies
"21/05/2021, 10:46",Nagaraju,Needs a lot of dedicated hours
"21/05/2021, 10:51",Krishan,Do they extend the validity of the course?
"21/05/2021, 10:52",Himanshu,For 2 months
"21/05/2021, 10:53",Nagaraju,Only if you have a good reason
"21/05/2021, 10:54",Nagaraju,Otherwise you have to pay 17k
"21/05/2021, 10:54",Nagaraju,For a year extension
"21/05/2021, 10:57",Dil,Which assignment currently u are... Have completed all topics content..
"21/05/2021, 10:57",Krishan,👍
"21/05/2021, 10:57",Krishan,👍
"21/05/2021, 10:58",Dil,Everybody is telling complete content and then assignments.. means each module content then assignments??
"21/05/2021, 10:59",Nagaraju,I complete assignments as I complete the content
"21/05/2021, 11:00",Nagaraju,Another person I know did content for 6 months and assignments for the next 6
"21/05/2021, 11:00",Nagaraju,So it's subjective
"21/05/2021, 11:02",Suyash,"I'm also following the same but as u mentioned the second strategy , which is more efficient?"
"21/05/2021, 11:02",Nagaraju,I can't say😅
"21/05/2021, 11:03",Nagaraju,If you went to second strategy you would have to revise/revisit content again before attempting assignment
"21/05/2021, 11:03",Nagaraju,That's what I thought
"21/05/2021, 11:03",Nagaraju,So I stuck to doing it as and when I completed assignment
"21/05/2021, 11:04",Nagaraju,My pace is not the best but I'm at
"21/05/2021, 11:04",Nagaraju,Using first approach
"21/05/2021, 11:18",Dil,6months 70% gud only
"21/05/2021, 11:19",Nagaraju,What I heard is
"21/05/2021, 11:20",Dil,Oo
"21/05/2021, 11:20",Dil,How many daily u r preparing r u working suraj
"21/05/2021, 11:20",Nagaraju,Self case study that is
"21/05/2021, 11:21",Nagaraju,I'm final year student
"21/05/2021, 11:21",Dil,Oo great ..best of luck..
"21/05/2021, 11:21",Nagaraju,I'm from non Cs
"21/05/2021, 11:22",Dil,I think u r preparing for 3hrs daily
"21/05/2021, 11:22",Nagaraju,Many things were new
"21/05/2021, 11:23",Nagaraju,2 hours yes
"21/05/2021, 11:25",Virat,I'm also from Non Cs background.. for me also coding part or solving assignment takes more time..
"21/05/2021, 11:26",Nagaraju,Yeah!
"21/05/2021, 11:40",Gagan,Any Tip for working professional?
"21/05/2021, 11:41",Gagan,I thought of completing it in 6 months.
"21/05/2021, 11:42",Sherya,Everything is same as SGD assignment just do the following things:
"21/05/2021, 11:43",Kirti,everyone thinks like that :)
"21/05/2021, 11:43",Dil,"I wake up @ 5:00 Am just to spend two hours dedicatedly.since this is WFH time,when ever work load is less I will watch tutorials..still my pace is not great though."
"21/05/2021, 11:44",Silam,So we can use SGD with skelaern? Right
"21/05/2021, 11:44",Sherya,How much have you completed content and assignment? and how much time is left?
"21/05/2021, 11:45",Dil,"I completed more than 100 days still in Module-3,completed till SGD assignment"
"21/05/2021, 11:46",Nagaraju,That's good
"21/05/2021, 11:46",Nagaraju,Module 3 is quite long
"21/05/2021, 11:59",Dil,No probs .. be positive may be u r learning deeply .. and also working professional
"21/05/2021, 12:00",Nav,Anyone here has worked with Unity3D?? I need some help
"21/05/2021, 12:03",Dil,Where were u know in course
"21/05/2021, 12:03",Dil,Am 60days but still in module 2
"21/05/2021, 12:04",Dil,Half part
"21/05/2021, 13:20",Aadesh,Have you checked the results along with loss function and without it?
"21/05/2021, 13:20",Sherya,Use the same loss funcn you used in SGD assignment
"21/05/2021, 13:21",Aadesh,Okay!!
"21/05/2021, 13:46",Gagan,I have joined the course 15 days back and now I have completed 50% of 1 module.
"21/05/2021, 14:22",Aadesh,What was the accuracy you obtained
"21/05/2021, 14:28",Virat,I have also started 15days back... I have completed upto module2 50%
"21/05/2021, 14:35",Suyash,Yes you're doing good . Just  don't stop putting efforts ..
"21/05/2021, 14:39",Gagan,Good going.
"21/05/2021, 14:44",Nagaraju,I watch the videos on 1.75x
"21/05/2021, 14:44",Nagaraju,That helps
"21/05/2021, 15:11",Virat,I am watching videos on normal mode only..
"21/05/2021, 15:13",Suyash,Try atleast 1.25x
"21/05/2021, 15:14",Suyash,It's not that fast but lets u save time also
"21/05/2021, 15:15",Virat,Ohk..👍👍
"21/05/2021, 15:20",Nagaraju,Yeah normal is quite slow
"21/05/2021, 15:21",Nagaraju,"Get a browser extension that allows you to set speed to any multiplier(like apart from the standard 1.25,1.5,1.75,2x)"
"21/05/2021, 15:32",Sherya,Logloss flattened at 0.085 when plotted against epochs
"21/05/2021, 15:33",Aadesh,Okay .. did you tune the hyperparameters
"21/05/2021, 15:34",Sherya,Noo.. you are talking assignment 8F right? It was not asked anywhere.
"21/05/2021, 15:35",Aadesh,Yaa.. it's optional
"21/05/2021, 15:35",Aadesh,If we want we can tune
"21/05/2021, 15:35",Aadesh,I don't see if they asked to plot us anything in 8F!!
"21/05/2021, 15:37",Sherya,Ohh then I didn't do it 😅
"21/05/2021, 15:37",Sherya,They will ask you to plot train loss against epochs
"21/05/2021, 15:38",Aadesh,Okay.. then I will do it!!
"21/05/2021, 15:50",Murat,Watch in 1.5x will save lot of time
"21/05/2021, 20:21",Priya,Can anyone tell me if there is any case study in AAIC which involves Object Detection or Image Segmentation techniques?

"21/05/2021, 22:54",Priyanka,It is from random forest assignment
"21/05/2021, 22:54",Aadesh,"But give time. If you understand once and very properly, then then it's great.."
"21/05/2021, 22:57",Naveen,"I think it's better to ask each other queries in terms of completion of assignments and   any conceptual discussion. Because there are different people Joining at different instances so someone will be advanced and some one will be slow. But believe me everyone are good at their own pace and If you really want to complete this course you'll definitely allocate time no matter what and how hard it is , you'll still find time .So it's better to Focus on gaining technical knowledge from each other instead of tracking course where we sre standing compared to other just to stay motivated . for your own good . I'm not offending anyone 😅 just wanted to tell"

"27/05/2021, 23:37",Sherya,Pc goes to sleep mode after a while. Does code execution stop then?
"27/05/2021, 23:37",Namita,No
"27/05/2021, 23:37",Sherya,Cool

"29/05/2021, 19:29",Krishan,The recursive function is not converging it seems.
"29/05/2021, 19:31",Sherya,The base condition for your recursion to stop might be wrong as a result your function never converges
"29/05/2021, 19:31",Murat,There is no recursion. This is the Mandatory python assignment where digits are replaced with #
"29/05/2021, 19:32",Murat,Only for and if statement I used
"29/05/2021, 19:33",Sherya,"Show the code, how will anyone find a solution otherwise? 😅"

"29/05/2021, 19:39",Krishan,"In the line#19, you are using recursion by calling the function again. Just return the modified string instead of calling the function again."
"29/05/2021, 19:40",Murat,I tried is_digit() and is_numeric() also.
"29/05/2021, 19:40",Murat,Same error
"29/05/2021, 19:40",Krishan,This is the issue
"29/05/2021, 19:41",Murat,Line 19 is the return function
"29/05/2021, 19:43",Sherya,Write return String instead of what you have written
"29/05/2021, 19:54",Tushar,Someone please help
"29/05/2021, 19:58",Simran,Which is this assignment?
"29/05/2021, 20:00",Tushar,"not an assignment, it's from artificial neural network"
"29/05/2021, 20:25",Simran,Try adding dropout layers after dense layers
"29/05/2021, 20:34",Tushar,Alright
"30/05/2021, 17:14",Krishan,Hello Folks!
"31/05/2021, 00:18",Simran,Hi friends anyone wrote monthly tests today?
"31/05/2021, 00:29",Neha,Hi

"31/05/2021, 10:41",Priyanka,"Hi all, need suggestions."
"31/05/2021, 10:50",Krishan,I feel it's always much better to do assignment after the theory because it gives more practical knowledge to the theory we have learnt.
"31/05/2021, 10:51",Priyanka,Thanks for nice input!
"31/05/2021, 10:51",Krishan,👍
"31/05/2021, 10:58",Priyanka,"If you have studied probability earlier in undergrad or before, it won't be that difficult. But if not may be you can try some other references of related topics and understand basics then it will be more clear by watching videos."

"31/05/2021, 17:45",Ashish,Thank you :)
"31/05/2021, 17:55",Dil,What needs to be donw assignment 8F
"31/05/2021, 17:55",Dil,I could not understand it
"31/05/2021, 17:56",Dil,Need to apply SGD by changing loss function train data or cv data?
"31/05/2021, 18:01",Ashish,You'll need to change the value of y in the log loss function. If y was taking the value 0 change it to y-  value and when y = 1 change it to y+ value. Everything else remains the same
"31/05/2021, 18:02",Ashish,N corresponds to number of points in train data
"31/05/2021, 18:03",Dil,"Ok,So on Train data set we need to find w and b by SGD and apply it on test data set?"
"31/05/2021, 18:04",Dil,Then what is related to cv on this line?
"31/05/2021, 18:04",Dil,<Media omitted>
"31/05/2021, 18:04",Dil,Instruction no4
"31/05/2021, 18:05",Ashish,While calculating y+ and y- the formula has N in it. This N corresponds to number of data points in train data.
"31/05/2021, 18:09",Dil,"That I did, Could not understand what are they saying about CV data set"
"31/05/2021, 18:11",Ashish,8E is done on the training set and 8F is done on cv and test set. So I believe that is why they mentioned ycv
"31/05/2021, 18:12",Ashish,If I remember correctly🙊

"04/06/2021, 19:12",Simran,You can manage the inactivity by making system active by using a VBS script which will press two keys in your keyboard every five minutes
"04/06/2021, 19:13",Simran,Try this script
"04/06/2021, 19:18",Simran,Sometimes Google colab will also check if we are keeping the system artificially awake..😀

"05/06/2021, 19:25",Namita,Model over fitted
"05/06/2021, 19:25",Sherya,Yes
"05/06/2021, 19:25",Sherya,What should be the results though?
"05/06/2021, 19:26",Sherya,"Because of the new features added as they asked in the assignment, it has overfit that is what I feel."
"05/06/2021, 19:27",Sherya,As the new features added are highly correlated with existing features
"05/06/2021, 19:28",Namita,The difference between train and test must not be more than 5%
"05/06/2021, 19:38",Sherya,Ohh okay
"05/06/2021, 19:39",Sherya,Can you please tell me what F1 score you got for the same assignment? I will do it again

"08/06/2021, 10:48",Nagaraju,You need to click the submit button
"08/06/2021, 10:49",Virat,Evaluated means you have to do changes in assignment.

"08/06/2021, 13:59",Namita,Something wrong with ur code or reduce the batch size while training the model
"08/06/2021, 13:59",Namita,Connect the rub time to gpu
"08/06/2021, 14:01",Krishan,Connected to GPU only.
"08/06/2021, 14:02",Namita,Which assignment it is taking 2 hours
"08/06/2021, 14:04",Krishan,"Text Classification for instance, for single Model."
"08/06/2021, 14:04",Naveen,"Reduce batch size to 4 , time will be increased but you won't get memory error atleast"
"08/06/2021, 14:05",Naveen,Or 8 may be
"08/06/2021, 14:07",Namita,<Media omitted>

"08/06/2021, 22:05",Sherya,They have provided all the files so use them. Only problem is with the training dataset they provided where one feature is missing so run only those codes which calculate the missing feature
"08/06/2021, 22:06",Sherya,For rest of the code use the files provided and don't recreate them.

"15/06/2021, 12:45",Virat,Sequential....
"15/06/2021, 12:52",Nagaraju,Sequential but I skipped live videos and some misc topics
"15/06/2021, 12:52",Nagaraju,Came back to them after going through all modules
"15/06/2021, 12:52",Virat,Live video will be ok...
"15/06/2021, 12:53",Virat,But important videos like code walkthrough.. I have seen in free time
"15/06/2021, 12:57",Vandana,Completing videos first and then one by one solving assignement all at a time. To ensure I again refer to code and fundamentals that helps to refer notes that time.
"15/06/2021, 12:59",Jooli,"So on an average how long you guys took to complete the videos ,assuming you might have practiced & taking notes...."
"15/06/2021, 13:00",Nagaraju,Assignments also I have done in sequence except for Malware

"17/06/2021, 16:52",Dil,Could some one throw some light
"17/06/2021, 16:56",Shivam,Can you please guide me for H1 process ?

"17/06/2021, 16:58",Ashok,Great 👏🏻 are you going for ms or job
"17/06/2021, 16:58",Dil,Some employer has to sponser you..I already hv H1 from my previous company...This new company is transfering it under cap exempt
"17/06/2021, 16:59",Naveen,hey from my undetstanding and few friends that have been graduating / started working i can say.. it is really huge and you can easily get into AI domain if you start of with analytics based roles / ml roles .
"17/06/2021, 16:59",Dil,I am a working guy with 11 yrs..already been to US on H1..
"17/06/2021, 16:59",Naveen,so i think youre planning to shift to ML roles right?
"17/06/2021, 17:00",Dil,Yeah..Right now I am Big Data developer..little ML exp..Want to move permanently to ML..
"17/06/2021, 17:00",Murat,"Also, I came to know from few friends that Datascience jobs pay upto 1L USD depending on the expertise"
"17/06/2021, 17:01",Naveen,Great... don't stop.. youve endless opportunities out there and AI is still in bullish mode....
"17/06/2021, 17:02",Dil,I do not know...reality is always different..My current company vidado.ai has industry's most accurate OCR.But unable to move into ML inside company it self..They are looking for Phd in Computer vision.
"17/06/2021, 17:03",Murat,Oh ok. Yes few companies ask for PhD in Machine learning areas of research
"17/06/2021, 17:04",Dil,"So,Do not know how is demand outside..In some interviews when I mentioned Little ML work I did in my role,even though it is prosuctinized,They are asking for ML Ops..MLOps is kind of hot stuff now"
"17/06/2021, 17:04",Naveen,True that.. if you have MS you can crack most of the roles. phd ..then sure shot .. people without MS or little/no experience in ML might face huge problem in job finding.
"17/06/2021, 17:46",Nav,"I am currently a final year undergrad. I'm thinking of doing a MS in statistics, is it a good idea? Also, idk but this course has made me so passionate about data science, I'm literally thinking of doing research in this field."

"17/06/2021, 18:07",Jyoti,I did masters in data science and learned a lot bcoz of the assignments they give in the course
"17/06/2021, 18:07",Nav,What were your core courses?
"17/06/2021, 18:07",Nikita,Where you did your masters?
"17/06/2021, 18:07",Nav,in your master's
"17/06/2021, 18:08",Jyoti,Data science and analytics
"17/06/2021, 18:08",Jyoti,In Ireland
"17/06/2021, 18:08",Naveen,Only if you're cent percent sure I would suggest you to take up course in statistics or else as everyone else are saying go for ms in data science / ms in CS ( with electives in ml/dl/ds )
"17/06/2021, 18:08",Jyoti,Covered entire ML and basic Deep learning and computer vision
"17/06/2021, 18:09",Nav,"I see what you mean, thanks for the holistic advice"

"17/06/2021, 18:10",Jyoti,I had 3 yrs of IT experience that's it
"17/06/2021, 18:10",Naveen,:)
"17/06/2021, 18:11",Jyoti,That too in production support not in data science
"17/06/2021, 18:12",Nikita,"Wow, that’s great Anoop!"
"17/06/2021, 18:12",Nav,"Okayy, I see. Amazing work!!"
"17/06/2021, 18:13",Jyoti,It's not like in india they won't teach u much u have to figure out the stuff in labs/assignments if u r opting for masters @916291084371
"17/06/2021, 18:13",Nav,Where in Ireland did you go to?
"17/06/2021, 18:14",Jyoti,My suggestion is go for it if u r investment is less than 15lks
"17/06/2021, 18:14",Jyoti,Munster Technological University
"17/06/2021, 18:15",Nav,Okayy

"17/06/2021, 18:18",Priyanka,"U have masters in DataScience that to in Ireland  ,so why did u join Applied AI course?"
"17/06/2021, 18:21",Jyoti,They don't teach u much in masters so to cover some concepts I took applied ai
"17/06/2021, 18:21",Jyoti,I have free time now searching for jobs stuff so iam doing assignments as well
"17/06/2021, 18:21",Priyanka,Ooh grt
"17/06/2021, 18:22",Naveen,Go Europe then . It's hundred percent possible. Especially Germany and Italy offer free masters
"17/06/2021, 18:24",Jyoti,If anyone planning for masters my suggestion is choose from US/UK/Canada /Germany
"17/06/2021, 18:43",Sanjana,Which is preferable doing an ms in datascience or artificial intelligence..?
"17/06/2021, 18:47",Jyoti,AI
"17/06/2021, 19:06",Nav,"Thanks for all the advices guys, really helpful!"
"17/06/2021, 19:17",Murat,MSc statistics will be definitely beneficial. I'm a post grad in statistics but I lack coding skills hence I took the course. Statistics is definitely a good career path
"17/06/2021, 19:18",Murat,Instead of doing Ms data science you can go for Msc statistics
"17/06/2021, 19:18",Murat,In foreign universities
"17/06/2021, 19:20",Krishna,IISC
"17/06/2021, 19:20",Ashok,For that we have to write gate exam right
"17/06/2021, 19:22",Murat,Gate is for Computer Science
"17/06/2021, 19:23",Murat,If you want to do Msc stats in IITs or IISC then go for JAM exam
"17/06/2021, 19:26",Nav,"The thing is i come from engg background, so idk how much of a viable option would be for me to give MSc stats. I really like statistics tho so there is a high chance i might go for MS stats"
"17/06/2021, 19:29",Murat,If you have statistics in Bachelors then only go for Msc stats. Else I would suggest go for Engineering related only
"17/06/2021, 19:48",Krishna,Yup
"17/06/2021, 20:10",Aniket,"If Anyone planning for UK  , to pursue masters... It's virtual fair month, on 24th of June , SI-Uk is organising for all Universities, explicitly universities are conducting their own virtual fair to on Microsoft meets."

When I was looking into the syllabus of other universities in Australia/UK, I found that most of the topics were covered by AAIC but this was not the case for NUS. I did speak to 2 of the students their and from what I understood and from their linkedin profile, they had done multiple projects / worked in related fields of DS and then joined NUS. For universities in Australia/UK whoever I spoke to had just graduated (UG)."

"30/06/2021, 09:52",Dil,Each assignment how much time it will take usually... 5 hours is enough..???
"30/06/2021, 09:56",Priyanshi,Depends on your coding skills and ML understanding.

"30/06/2021, 21:23",Nitya,Bias is inversely proportional to variance … as bias decreases variance increases but you can’t decrease bias too much coz of overfitting problems similarly you can’t increase bias too much bcoz u will be encountered with underfitting problem .. ie you can’t decrease or increase both of them too much .. hence you need a trade off between them

"08/07/2021, 07:11",Priyanshi,Weight and bias difference should be in terms of 10^-3
"08/07/2021, 15:23",Ashish,"Hello,"
"08/07/2021, 15:24",Ashish,Hi. This is for one of my friends who is conducting a research. It would be great if you could fill up this form if you meet the criteria. Thank you

"08/07/2021, 20:20",Namita,hello in machine translation my model is predicting same character irrespective of input what might be reason? any suggestions.
"09/07/2021, 06:31",Shyam,"Hi, this happened to me when I put <sos> in target sentence. Check preprocessing of input to decoder and target sentence"
"09/07/2021, 17:22",Dil,Am first reading all the content .. ml after that DL ..then I want to start assignments
"09/07/2021, 17:23",Dil,Is it correct one
"09/07/2021, 17:28",Karam,"Everyone with the strategy that works for him/her. for me, Content and assignments goes hand in hand👌"
"09/07/2021, 18:01",Sherya,"Try using a mix of the 2 approaches i.e watch all videos related to ML then solve all ML assignments and then go for DL videos first, followed by DL assignments."
"09/07/2021, 18:03",Aadesh,Better to complete the module and do the assignments related to those modules...in my point of view this is the better Otherwise you have to recall again all the concepts and it'll consume more time
"09/07/2021, 18:04",Raju,This takes less time too
"09/07/2021, 18:13",Priyanka,Gone through that
"09/07/2021, 18:13",Priyanka,And suffering now 😂
"09/07/2021, 18:14",Priyanka,Bt yeah revision is happening
"09/07/2021, 18:14",Priyanka,That's a good takeaway
"09/07/2021, 19:30",Dil,U completed both ml and DL all topics ..now where where u
"09/07/2021, 19:48",Namita,My suggestion is do parallely assignment + content times saves a lot quickly u can complete assignment
"09/07/2021, 19:49",Sukh,Videos on weekdays and assignments on weekends works well for me
"09/07/2021, 19:50",Namita,Yup being working employee I follow same trend
"09/07/2021, 19:52",Sukh,Yep same
"09/07/2021, 20:05",Priyanka,Software engineer?
"09/07/2021, 20:06",Namita,Data scientist
"09/07/2021, 20:06",Priyanka,Ooh lovely
"09/07/2021, 20:08",Silam,Then why did you join ..if you already working as data scientist..
"09/07/2021, 20:11",Priyanka,The kind of value that this course  adds  to ur resume is grt
"09/07/2021, 20:12",Priyanka,"Even there is guy who did masters in Data science from Ireland , he also took this course"
"09/07/2021, 20:13",Devansh,Great😳

"09/07/2021, 20:45",Dil,Which company
"09/07/2021, 20:45",Namita,Nope from  LinkedIn in a start up
"09/07/2021, 21:03",Onkar,"So, can we add the course certificate in resume?"
"09/07/2021, 21:07",Priyanka,Yeah u can add bt its the assignments and case studies that will make u standout in resume'
"09/07/2021, 21:31",Silam,👍

"10/07/2021, 13:29",Raju,"In assignment 8 linear model ""C""  how did we plot the linear regression plot"
"10/07/2021, 13:29",Raju,The regression lin to be specific
"10/07/2021, 13:29",Raju,Line*
"10/07/2021, 13:44",Raju,Is it similar to the draw_line function in 8A
"10/07/2021, 13:55",Aman,bro i am having problem in tf-idf vectorizer assignment
"10/07/2021, 13:56",Abhinav,Yes plot all the data point with scatter plot and then try to plot the line.
"10/07/2021, 13:56",Abhinav,?
"10/07/2021, 13:58",Aman,I have submitted it but it is in evaluation mode.
"10/07/2021, 13:58",Aman,With the instructions actually
"10/07/2021, 13:59",Aman,And functional they told me to make
"10/07/2021, 14:00",Aman,Which we recall all three values.
"10/07/2021, 14:02",Raju,So you are having problems with transform function ??
"10/07/2021, 14:02",Raju,Or fit function ?
"10/07/2021, 14:03",Aman,fit function.
"10/07/2021, 14:03",Aman,inside the fit function i have to call the idf value function.
"10/07/2021, 14:05",Raju,So idf values are not inline with that of sklearn ?
"10/07/2021, 14:06",Raju,Thanks Hafiz bhai
"10/07/2021, 14:31",Aman,inide fit function - we need to call idf function.

"10/07/2021, 19:41",Aman,somebody up for 2nd task please?
"10/07/2021, 19:59",Abhinav,Use n_jobs °=-1
"10/07/2021, 20:00",Abhinav,Have you used the dataset from drive?? Or from your local drive??
"10/07/2021, 20:02",Abhinav,Read np.argsort documentation you can do it with it.
"10/07/2021, 20:03",Raghvendra,By default it is n_job=-1  it will consider all th processors. For xgb we must not use it I think  single the o/p of one model is I/p to other model
"10/07/2021, 20:04",Raghvendra,Dataset from the drive and I am able to preprocess the data as well
"10/07/2021, 20:05",Abhinav,Yes you are correct but we parallelized each data point of one model
"10/07/2021, 20:06",Priyanshi,Show your hyperparams set and you can try lightgbm.
"10/07/2021, 20:07",Abhinav,How much time it takes for hypermater tuning??
"10/07/2021, 20:09",Raghvendra,I did not training the  hyper parameters yet.
"10/07/2021, 20:10",Raghvendra,I did not train the hyper parameters yet
"10/07/2021, 20:58",Abhinav,I am not asking your best hyperparameter

"12/07/2021, 10:39",Tushar,this is the derivative of Loss wrt w1
"12/07/2021, 10:39",Tushar,<Media omitted>
"12/07/2021, 10:57",Priyanshi,Yes you need to specify the image size in generator.
"12/07/2021, 19:18",Kirti,<Media omitted>
"12/07/2021, 19:18",Kirti,Is this correct?
"12/07/2021, 19:19",Param,yes
"12/07/2021, 19:21",Kirti,but we used Euclidean distance for LSH..that's also for categorical variable.
"12/07/2021, 19:22",Param,well..yeah thats point🤔
"12/07/2021, 19:22",Sherya,For binary vectors we use Hamming distance usually
"12/07/2021, 19:23",Sherya,Vector conversion of a categorical variable will be a binary vector
"12/07/2021, 19:26",Kirti,Yes I understood. But how euclidean and manhattan is not for knn?
"12/07/2021, 19:26",Kirti,I couldn't get that
"12/07/2021, 19:27",Sherya,Well these mcqs don't make sense a lot of times. All three are used to calculate distances between vectors. In this case Manhattan distance and Hamming distance would give the same result
"12/07/2021, 20:37",Kirti,Ya..Got it
"13/07/2021, 00:05",Jyoti,Guys how long it took for u to train cnn on cifr?
"13/07/2021, 00:25",Priyanshi,2.5 to 3 hours
"13/07/2021, 00:27",Priyanshi,GPU. 103s per epoch. total 92 epochs it took to reach required accuracy
"13/07/2021, 00:32",Jyoti,On cpu?
"13/07/2021, 01:30",Dharmesh,hello can any one answer this i m confused
"13/07/2021, 01:31",Dharmesh,I m thinking either 1 or 4 is the right answer
"13/07/2021, 01:32",Nagaraju,Model 1 i would say
"13/07/2021, 01:32",Nagaraju,That's one of the criteria to identify overfitting models as well
"13/07/2021, 01:32",Dharmesh,👍🏻
"13/07/2021, 01:32",Nagaraju,Correct me if I'm wrong🤞

"13/07/2021, 12:17",Nagaraju,Practice python on hackerrank
"13/07/2021, 12:17",Nagaraju,Even I was non Cs

"13/07/2021, 12:17",Nagaraju,Only this helped
"13/07/2021, 12:18",Dil,At least I need to see some coding after that I will analyse and will correlate
"13/07/2021, 12:18",Priyanshi,Also do optional python assignments. It will give you clarity of syntaxes.
"13/07/2021, 12:18",Dil,Kk
"13/07/2021, 12:18",Sherya,Try to solve the questions on paper first before coding. The reason you are not able to solve the questions is you have not understood the problem 100%. Try to solve it on paper as if you were teaching a kid.
"13/07/2021, 12:18",Nagaraju,Yes yes
"13/07/2021, 12:19",Priyanshi,Yes.
"13/07/2021, 12:19",Dil,Wow very gud suggestions.. in hackers rank will have solutions too..
"13/07/2021, 12:20",Dil,Any books we can refer??

"13/07/2021, 17:20",Tushar,For me also
"13/07/2021, 17:23",Priyanka,In backprop assignment i think assertion error that is coming
"13/07/2021, 17:23",Priyanka,"that has be changed ,right?"
"13/07/2021, 17:48",Abhinav,Which part? Gradient checking?
"13/07/2021, 18:15",Priyanka,In grader function three
"13/07/2021, 18:15",Priyanka,Where we we have calculate gradients
"13/07/2021, 18:15",Priyanka,while doing backprop
"13/07/2021, 18:55",Abhinav,Grader function for back propagation is correct
"13/07/2021, 19:00",Priyanka,My all values are correct
"13/07/2021, 19:00",Priyanka,Just dw1
"13/07/2021, 19:00",Priyanka,Is incorrect
"13/07/2021, 19:01",Priyanka,That too last value after decimal os different otherwise whole vakue is same as it is
"13/07/2021, 19:53",Abhinav,Dw1 has two path in that network please recheck the network diagram
"13/07/2021, 19:53",Abhinav,You have to add the two path
"13/07/2021, 21:02",Aadesh,Checkout productionization& deployment module -  in that they implemented Amazon fine food reviews end to end

"14/07/2021, 11:14",Silam,Great 👍
"14/07/2021, 11:20",Raju,Okay okay O(1) haa interesting
"14/07/2021, 11:25",Raju,"We can use simple 1d array right With its index-values corresponding to key - value that way add,minus , min, max can be done in O(1)"
"14/07/2021, 11:49",Sachin,How will get_max/get_min operations work in O(1) for arrays?
"14/07/2021, 11:51",Namita,sort the array
"14/07/2021, 11:51",Namita,a[0] min a[len(a)-1] max
"14/07/2021, 12:03",Sachin,Then we are loosing the keys! Need to use another array for keys and sort that as well.
"14/07/2021, 12:04",Sherya,Use dictionaries
"14/07/2021, 12:04",Namita,merge sort nlogn
"14/07/2021, 12:05",Sachin,Yes 🤔 but how can we get the key with highest value in O(1)?
"14/07/2021, 12:06",Sachin,"Yup, but if sorting is required then it won't be of O(1) no?"
"14/07/2021, 12:06",Sherya,<Media omitted>
"14/07/2021, 12:06",Raju,Using this array indexes for keys
"14/07/2021, 12:06",Raju,Last value will be max
"14/07/2021, 12:06",Raju,First value will be min
"14/07/2021, 12:07",Raju,We don't need to sort as well

"14/07/2021, 18:15",Sherya,Read newspapers and books loudly so you get familiarised with your own voice and start thinking in English rather than thinking in Hindi and then translating it to English.
"14/07/2021, 18:16",Abhi,Read Hindu editorials for vocabulary
"14/07/2021, 18:19",Ayush,ok 👍thank you so much for these tips and I will follow this.

"15/07/2021, 16:32",Karan,"Of for that, I have used set difference"
"15/07/2021, 16:32",Rohan,Set intersection
"15/07/2021, 16:34",Rohan,Have they not accepted it?
"15/07/2021, 16:44",Karan,"Got confused on question number, I m stuck in conditional probability question."
"15/07/2021, 16:57",Nagaraju,Correct
"15/07/2021, 17:23",Rohan,"If u able to manually solve the problem, try and infer logic from that and then code...For conditional probability, you will have to aggregate the count of values based on conditions and then directly apply formula. So, for loop and if-else will be required."
"15/07/2021, 17:29",Param,my TL gave me a task to build a model which will predict the length of stay of covid patient...i drove by all the sites...but couldn't find any relevant dataset
"15/07/2021, 17:29",Param,can anyone help me plz🥲
"15/07/2021, 17:32",Rohan,"Wow interesting, but what kind of output are they expecting from the model"
"15/07/2021, 17:32",Rohan,You will need CT score also
"15/07/2021, 17:34",Rohan,"You can collect by making a questionare, you will have to take help of doctor to prepare questionare"
"15/07/2021, 17:35",Param,thanks Rajat🥲
"15/07/2021, 17:36",Rohan,Are u working as data engineer?
"15/07/2021, 17:36",Param,i was looking ..if i could get the datasets through kaggle ..or GitHub

"15/07/2021, 20:38",Priyanshi,What's the issue?
"15/07/2021, 20:39",Aman,how to start
"15/07/2021, 20:39",Aman,sklearn would require or not?
"15/07/2021, 20:39",Priyanshi,No only import math
"15/07/2021, 20:47",Dil,Which module
"15/07/2021, 21:23",Rakhi,"Hi all,"
"15/07/2021, 21:45",Priyanshi,Show your architecture code.
"15/07/2021, 21:49",Rakhi,initializer = tf.keras.initializers.he_normal(seed=0)
"15/07/2021, 21:52",Priyanshi,Keep kernel size same(preferably odd) and change number of filters everywhere.
"15/07/2021, 21:54",Rakhi,ok let me try
"15/07/2021, 21:56",Aadesh,"Hi guys,"
"15/07/2021, 22:12",Ayush,Very nicely done 👍
"15/07/2021, 22:12",Aadesh,Thanks
"15/07/2021, 22:17",Abhinav,Development video is awesome👍🏻👌🏻
"15/07/2021, 22:18",Aadesh,Thanks a lot!
"15/07/2021, 22:19",Abhinav,What is the reason behind that random forests works better that gbdt?
"15/07/2021, 22:19",Abhinav,Any intuition??
"15/07/2021, 22:19",Raghav,Very Nicee👍👍
"15/07/2021, 22:20",Namita,Might be less time for training
"15/07/2021, 22:23",Krishna,"Good article,"
"15/07/2021, 22:24",Krishna,+1
"15/07/2021, 22:27",Abhinav,Will Training time affect the model performance?
"15/07/2021, 22:29",Namita,Generally when you are working in a companies u use cloud services as the training time increases u need to pay more so most of start ups use light weighted models and in case of deep learning models if you train alot they tend to overfit
"15/07/2021, 22:30",Krishna,But here he used small dataset when compared to companies
"15/07/2021, 22:32",Krishna,Anyone here knows how to extract text from PDF files?
"15/07/2021, 22:33",Abhinav,I get your point
"15/07/2021, 22:56",Karam,"There is a live session on this topic, though I don't know the exact module it appears in😊"

"16/07/2021, 08:52",Abhinav,I think around 50
"16/07/2021, 08:52",Abhinav,Auc
"16/07/2021, 08:52",Priyanka,you mean 0.5?
"16/07/2021, 08:52",Abhinav,Yes
"16/07/2021, 08:53",Priyanka,was your assignment marked DONE on this score?
"16/07/2021, 08:53",Abhinav,Yes
"16/07/2021, 08:53",Priyanka,cool
"16/07/2021, 08:53",Abhinav,5b is the first auc task?
"16/07/2021, 08:54",Abhinav,Then 0.5 auc is right auc
"16/07/2021, 08:54",Priyanka,in 5a also auc calculation is there
"16/07/2021, 08:54",Priyanka,please check from your notebook and confirm me
"16/07/2021, 08:54",Abhinav,Okay
"16/07/2021, 08:56",Raju,Yes
"16/07/2021, 08:57",Raju,Mine to came out to be 0.488 auc score for 5a
"16/07/2021, 08:57",Priyanka,yes that is correct
"16/07/2021, 08:58",Raju,👌👌
"16/07/2021, 08:58",Priyanka,for  5b it is auc = 0.9377300000000001

"19/07/2021, 08:44",Priyanshi,How to check if you have converged on a saddle point?
"19/07/2021, 08:54",Aadesh,I think we would not know that very straight.. We will have to try with different learning rate different optimizer.
"19/07/2021, 08:57",Raju,you can use contour plot to  figure that out if you have converged at saddle point
"19/07/2021, 08:58",Priyanshi,But how will you know during training phase?
"19/07/2021, 08:58",Priyanshi,Yeah that's what I thought
"19/07/2021, 09:01",Aadesh,This can be done.. but can you elaborate more on the thought process?
"19/07/2021, 09:04",Raju,If we have two intersecting lines (contour lines )and if we observe a square like structure with that two lines intersecting at squares diagonal we can say this might me a saddle point
"19/07/2021, 09:04",Raju,If that makes sense
"19/07/2021, 09:04",Abhinav,I think both the training and test error will be high. Eventhogh you have enough data point
"19/07/2021, 09:05",Raju,<Media omitted>
"19/07/2021, 09:07",Aadesh,Yes.. but we will have to be sure that thisis only because of saddle point and not any other factors.
"19/07/2021, 09:08",Abhinav,Agreed 👍
"19/07/2021, 09:08",Raju,That's the way to go
"19/07/2021, 09:08",Aadesh,We can we plot like this? I don't know if we can.
"19/07/2021, 09:11",Raju,Yet to get my hands dirty with back prop assignment just yesterday I finished the topic of saddle point 😂😂

"19/07/2021, 22:41",Ashish,Hi. Has anyone worked on a single class classification problem?
"19/07/2021, 22:51",Tushar,I think single class classification boils down to binary class itself
"19/07/2021, 22:53",Tushar,"Because if we have output as infected, other class will be not infected with probability (1-p)"

"20/07/2021, 16:25",Karam,It took me around 8hrs on 8gb ram
"20/07/2021, 16:25",Krishna,Interview question: let's say 3 prime numbers and thier sum is 100 and which are not exceed 36. What are the possible combinations we have
"20/07/2021, 16:25",Krishna,It's not only number. Difference between those numbers
"20/07/2021, 16:28",Sherya,How is this possible?
"20/07/2021, 17:20",Nagaraju,Difference between those numbers do not exceed 36?
"20/07/2021, 17:50",Ganesh,"To solve any problem,"
"20/07/2021, 17:57",Kirti,here's an example
"20/07/2021, 17:59",Kirti,This kind of problems we solved during JEE prep. But now I couldn't able to do😂
"20/07/2021, 18:05",Namita,Coding task
"20/07/2021, 18:05",Ganesh,"Addition of any two odd numbers is even, hence we need to keep '2' as a mandatory number in the combination of all 3 no.s"
"20/07/2021, 18:06",Kirti,Yes this is one possible ans.
"20/07/2021, 18:06",Ganesh,"Correct, because they want number of possible combinations.."
"20/07/2021, 18:07",Kirti,yes
"20/07/2021, 18:23",Priyanka,Only 1 possible : 2+37+61
"20/07/2021, 18:24",Dil,"2,19,79.. difference is more than 36... That is the only one"
"20/07/2021, 21:33",Sachin,Yes I think it a possible answers
"20/07/2021, 21:34",Sachin,"If you knows ans, please send"
"20/07/2021, 22:40",Priyanka,In callbacks assignment we have build 5 dense layer but how do I decide no of units in each layers?

"21/07/2021, 18:25",Aadesh,Guys I have a question:
"21/07/2021, 18:27",Aadesh,And why?
"21/07/2021, 18:30",Priyanshi,C in SVM?
"21/07/2021, 18:30",Ganesh,it would be better if you clearly say what is the hyper parameter instead of notation.
"21/07/2021, 18:30",Abhinav,If c=1 then more reg in logistics regression.
"21/07/2021, 18:32",Aadesh,C in liner/logistics/svm. To me this question was for linear reg
"21/07/2021, 18:33",Aadesh,What about SVM and linear reg
"21/07/2021, 18:33",Abhinav,C is high mean high regularisation
"21/07/2021, 18:34",Aadesh,Why?
"21/07/2021, 18:39",Sherya,"C in sklearn is inversely proportional to regularisation term lambda used in formulation of L.R/SVM. If lambda is large then, you are penalizing your large weights more. Since, C is inversely proportional to lambda, high C would mean low lambda hence less regularisation i.e more chance your model overfits."
"21/07/2021, 18:41",Sherya,"On the contrary, low C would mean high lambda hence more regularisation i.e your model underfits."
"21/07/2021, 18:42",Aadesh,Okay...
"21/07/2021, 18:44",Aadesh,I got it this way ..
"21/07/2021, 18:45",Aadesh,Please correct if I am wrong
"21/07/2021, 18:45",Sherya,C is not multiplied with the error term but the weights.

"21/07/2021, 18:48",Aadesh,If you if you check svm: c is associated with the error term!
"21/07/2021, 18:51",Sherya,"Well for SVM, things change slightly. But the whole idea still remains the same. If you have large C, lambda will be low i.e less regularisation so you will make less error on training data but your model won't generalize well and will overfit."
"21/07/2021, 18:55",Aadesh,<Media omitted>
"21/07/2021, 18:55",Aadesh,<Media omitted>
"21/07/2021, 18:55",Aadesh,Conclusion: lower value of c will give more regularisation
"21/07/2021, 18:55",Sherya,Yup
"21/07/2021, 19:45",Nagaraju,In this case C that is used is actually 1/lambda
"21/07/2021, 19:51",Aadesh,Yes

"27/07/2021, 14:10",Dil,Already we are in that group .. why we need to join
"27/07/2021, 14:10",Priyanka,This was for other people..like if someone asks for invite link
"27/07/2021, 14:11",Priyanka,You are already here..no worries😄

"27/07/2021, 16:04",Nitya,I think LRscheduler callback is already there in keras
"27/07/2021, 16:05",Priyanka,Yeah bt we have to modify it on two which is being asked in assignment
"27/07/2021, 16:05",Priyanka,two conditions*
"27/07/2021, 16:06",Priyanshi,For second condition you can use lr schedule on plateu
"27/07/2021, 16:07",Priyanshi,ReduceLROnPlateau
"27/07/2021, 16:10",Priyanka,ok ill check that out🤟
"27/07/2021, 16:11",Priyanshi,Also why **epoch? And why multiply 1-0.05 instead of 0.95?
"27/07/2021, 16:12",Priyanka,ooh sry i did  these changes but pasted earlier code here🤦‍♂️
"27/07/2021, 19:24",Priyanka,<Media omitted>
"27/07/2021, 19:25",Priyanka,even after casting result to float the anwser is the eroor is same

"28/07/2021, 05:55",Dil,For actors clustering I got graph like this
"28/07/2021, 05:55",Dil,Does not look like correct clustering .is it correct?
"28/07/2021, 05:58",Dil,"I plotted actor embedings ,divided it into three clusters based on labels I got from kmeans"
"28/07/2021, 06:50",Dil,Movies also got similar plot for 3 clusters
"28/07/2021, 06:51",Dil,Is it valid?
"28/07/2021, 07:32",Priyanka,"Thanks for asking man , ultimately i solved it🤟🏻"
"28/07/2021, 08:37",Ashish,"Hi. In the spoken digit assignment, Model 1, in the instructions it is mentioned that X_train_pad_seq and X_train mask needs to be sent to the LSTM layer. Whereas in the model. summary() the team provided, only the input_layer is being sent to the LSTM layer. Can someone clarify what needs to be sent to the LSTM layer? Thank you"

"28/07/2021, 09:51",Ashish,This message was deleted
"28/07/2021, 09:53",Ashish,Can the padded sequence and mask sequence be combined together and this be passed to the LSTM layer? i.e the shape of the input layer would be 35280 (17640 + 17640)?
"28/07/2021, 10:06",Priya,I have not done this assignment but I think you can do numpy append to make it 35k
"28/07/2021, 10:09",Ashish,Okay 👍. I used np.hstack() to combine padded seq & mask seq. Not sure if doing this way is acceptable for the assignment. Thank you :)
"28/07/2021, 10:10",Ashish,Like if we can combine them and pass it to the lstm layer or not
"28/07/2021, 15:42",Silam,<Media omitted>
"28/07/2021, 15:45",Dil,Mine is different than this..hv u used any tuning parameters in TSNE or just plain
"28/07/2021, 18:10",Sherya,<Media omitted>
"28/07/2021, 18:10",Sherya,What is the solution for this? No graphs are displayed. I followed the steps in official tutorial but got no results
"28/07/2021, 18:12",Nav,1) Check if you have saved the log files correctly and if you're passing the correct path of the log files to the tensorboard callbacks or not
"28/07/2021, 18:13",Priyanshi,Show tb code
"28/07/2021, 18:14",Sherya,<Media omitted>
"28/07/2021, 18:15",Sherya,<Media omitted>
"28/07/2021, 18:15",Priyanshi,Remove \ from path
"28/07/2021, 18:15",Nagaraju,Make sure you exit tensor board
"28/07/2021, 18:16",Priyanshi,Just put single \ here
"28/07/2021, 18:17",Sherya,Okay I will try
"28/07/2021, 18:21",Sherya,<Media omitted>
"28/07/2021, 18:21",Sherya,Same result
"28/07/2021, 18:22",Nav,Change your working directory
"28/07/2021, 18:22",Nav,In this code add a os.chdir()
"28/07/2021, 18:23",Nav,and mention the path where the logs are
"28/07/2021, 18:23",Nav,then it should work
"28/07/2021, 18:23",Nav,Add the os.chdir() before log_dir
"28/07/2021, 18:24",Sherya,I would throw an error right?
"28/07/2021, 18:24",Nav,You can do two things
"28/07/2021, 18:24",Nav,One is mention pass the path of the log files as your log_dir in your callback
"28/07/2021, 18:24",Nav,Or
"28/07/2021, 18:25",Nav,"Change your working directory to where the log files are being saved, then use the callback"
"28/07/2021, 18:25",Sherya,Okay. I will try both
"28/07/2021, 18:25",Nav,Okay
"28/07/2021, 18:25",Sherya,Thankyou :)
"28/07/2021, 18:26",Nav,I'm still not sure if this is the solution to your problem or not 😂😂
"28/07/2021, 18:27",Sherya,I will try and let you know 😂
"28/07/2021, 19:41",Pragya,Hi Guys

"28/07/2021, 19:41",Pragya,we could be a team
"28/07/2021, 20:39",Priyanka,In call back assignment what should be our batch size and epoch?
"28/07/2021, 20:40",Sherya,batch size: default and epochs 20
"28/07/2021, 20:46",Priyanka,Sumeet bro what is val_accuracy u got for model 1?
"28/07/2021, 20:47",Sherya,In the range of 0.5
"28/07/2021, 20:47",Priyanka,Same here
"28/07/2021, 20:49",Priyanka,<Media omitted>
"28/07/2021, 20:49",Priyanka,Accuracy vs epoch plot
"28/07/2021, 20:52",Nav,Bro your tensorboard callback worked?
"28/07/2021, 20:52",Sherya,No
"28/07/2021, 20:52",Sherya,:(
"28/07/2021, 20:53",Sherya,I completed everything but that's the only part left now
"28/07/2021, 20:54",Nav,Show your code again
"28/07/2021, 20:54",Nav,I mean the current one
"28/07/2021, 20:54",Sherya,I tried everything but because nothing worked I deleted the code
"28/07/2021, 20:54",Priyanshi,Write a code to delete the log folder before you specify the log folder path in a variable. When you call tb just say log and nothing else.
"28/07/2021, 20:54",Sherya,I will start fresh in an hour
"28/07/2021, 20:55",Sherya,Okay
"28/07/2021, 21:28",Prajwal,Hi guys: Have anyone worked on this:
"28/07/2021, 21:28",Prajwal,"Need help, if any one have done or have idea, please reply"
"28/07/2021, 21:51",Rohit,use %tensorboard --logdir $<path>
"28/07/2021, 21:52",Rohit,"and refresh ur tensorboard once model fitting begins, it will turn to active if not automatically"
"29/07/2021, 00:56",Sherya,Thankyou for the suggestions. I completed it :)

"29/07/2021, 04:53",Nagaraju,Great question
"29/07/2021, 05:00",Nagaraju,My answer:
"29/07/2021, 05:03",Nagaraju,"Another point is that,"
"29/07/2021, 05:03",Nagaraju,Please correct me if I'm wrong🙏🏼
"29/07/2021, 07:23",Sherya,"The given problem involves a medical dataset which is highly imbalanced requiring to use Micro recall score as evaluation metric. Micro recall score is grossly low. Even if we consider micro precision, it's pretty low. Hence the model is both bad for saving lives and business."
"29/07/2021, 07:24",Sachin,Yes right
"29/07/2021, 07:25",Sachin,Please explain this point I didn't get it
"29/07/2021, 07:27",Sherya,People with fatal conditions are being classified as normal i.e too many False Negatives and hence high Type 2 error.

"29/07/2021, 12:00",Priya,I am trying to build a complex model for predicting stock prices in future by using pre-trained BERT which gives embeddings of the news articles that I feed it with and then I want to combine these features with the series of past prices to feed to an lstm model to get the final predictions. I am facing doubt about how to combine the embeddings with the prices?
"29/07/2021, 12:00",Priya,Please help to clarify my doubt!
"29/07/2021, 13:35",Ganesh,Most popular ways is to concatenate
"29/07/2021, 13:38",Ganesh,Let's suppose bert is giving 512 dim vector as an embedding.
"29/07/2021, 15:40",Priya,ok...so 513 for a single day only.....I want to forecast based on the past 30 days price......will that be like a multivariate time series problem?
"29/07/2021, 16:51",Namita,do anyone have mock2 interview questions??
"29/07/2021, 18:06",Ganesh,Exactly
"29/07/2021, 18:07",Ganesh,If you've multiple news
"29/07/2021, 18:08",Ganesh,"For each timestep, feed 513 dimensional vector..now you can have 30 timesteps in lstm.."
"29/07/2021, 18:13",Ganesh,"Bro, BERT will give you sentence embedding, do not use word embedding."
"29/07/2021, 18:14",Priya,👍🙏
"29/07/2021, 23:54",Paridhi,"Hi everyone,"
"30/07/2021, 00:39",Nagaraju,Are you finding decision boundary or confidence inyerval
"30/07/2021, 00:41",Paridhi,If jee score will be greater than 35.13 then which class will be of higher probability.
"30/07/2021, 00:43",Nagaraju,Why don't you formulate a hypothesis
"30/07/2021, 00:45",Nagaraju,For X>=35.13 you'll just have to find the area of this portion in the normal distribution
"30/07/2021, 00:45",Paridhi,Yeah.. Thank you
"30/07/2021, 00:45",Nagaraju,You will get a probability
"30/07/2021, 00:47",Paridhi,Yes actually this is a question asked by professor.. As per my understanding.. Probability of student will graduate with in 5 year will be greater in that area
"30/07/2021, 00:47",Paridhi,What do you think?
"30/07/2021, 00:47",Nagaraju,I'll get back to you
"30/07/2021, 00:55",Nagaraju,<Media omitted>
"30/07/2021, 00:55",Nagaraju,Which is a very small value
"30/07/2021, 00:55",Nagaraju,so p(x>=35.15) = 2.497471701556897e-06
"30/07/2021, 00:55",Nagaraju,I think so
"30/07/2021, 00:56",Paridhi,But if someone ask.. Like that region will belong to whom
"30/07/2021, 00:56",Paridhi,Class A Or class B then
"30/07/2021, 00:56",Paridhi,Class A will be correct... Right?
"30/07/2021, 00:57",Nagaraju,This is the probability that an individual will score more than 35.13 given that he graduated within 5 years
"30/07/2021, 00:58",Nagaraju,So
"30/07/2021, 01:01",Paridhi,Okay

"30/07/2021, 22:52",Suryansh,+1
"31/07/2021, 01:00",Guru,"how to select top features, when total number of data points and dimension is very large???"
"31/07/2021, 01:01",Priyanshi,Use random forest or select k best
"31/07/2021, 01:01",Priyanshi,Select k best is available in sklearn
"31/07/2021, 01:02",Guru,"already tried, model wont train because of high dimension and shape"
"31/07/2021, 01:03",Guru,"shape --> (2110586, 324701)"
"31/07/2021, 01:07",Priyanshi,Why don't you try pca?
"31/07/2021, 01:09",Guru,"nice idea, thanks😁"
"31/07/2021, 01:31",Guru,"wont works for sparse , any other suggestions?"
"31/07/2021, 01:33",Sherya,Use L1 regularizer
"31/07/2021, 01:34",Guru,with logistic ?
"31/07/2021, 01:35",Sherya,Yup. Not sure it will work but just give it a try
"31/07/2021, 01:35",Sherya,Non important features will be removed
"31/07/2021, 01:35",Guru,already tried
"31/07/2021, 01:36",Guru,the problem is that because of higher dimension i am not been able to train any model though thus i need to reduce dimension to train a model
"31/07/2021, 01:37",Guru,"shape --> (2110586, 324701)"
"31/07/2021, 01:37",Sherya,"Divide features into groups. Fit the model on batches, and then select the tip features from each batch"
"31/07/2021, 01:38",Sherya,top*
"31/07/2021, 01:38",Guru,hey great idea
"31/07/2021, 01:38",Guru,wait i try
"31/07/2021, 01:39",Sherya,Do it randomly
"31/07/2021, 02:48",Guru,its working thanks sumeet
"31/07/2021, 07:03",Murat,"Hi Sumeet, could not understand, dividing features into groups and then selecting top features. Can you explain?"
"31/07/2021, 08:43",Nagaraju,You can do one thing
"31/07/2021, 08:43",Nagaraju,You can use Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)
"31/07/2021, 08:58",Rohit,Is selecting top features from each batch equivalent to selecting top from complete data ?
"31/07/2021, 08:59",Priyanshi,Are you using random forest?
"31/07/2021, 08:59",Rohit,Yes
"31/07/2021, 09:26",Priyanshi,I think no as features are split based on gain it calculates gain of feature i based on other features.
"31/07/2021, 09:39",Ganesh,What kind of data it is.?
"31/07/2021, 09:39",Ganesh,"If it's a sparse data, logistic regression won't take more time."
"31/07/2021, 09:40",Ganesh,Another idea could be to selcet words with high idf values.
"31/07/2021, 09:47",Janhavi,Hey folks..gm
"31/07/2021, 09:47",Janhavi,"I told that, we can consider different combinations of each team/squad as each row/datapoint & pick each player's performance,age,strike rate etc to be the features & pose this problem as a regression task by cumulatively averaging the feature scores/some performance score based on the previous test series (target feature : Cumulative score out of 10). But he told I was wrong in my approach & he expected some kind of weighted approach to this kind of scenario."
"31/07/2021, 09:48",Janhavi,"So, I dono what could be the answer for this, any ideas would benefit me alot ?"
"31/07/2021, 09:51",Nagaraju,Can we perform time series forecasting on runs/average runs
"31/07/2021, 09:51",Nagaraju,And select top batsman from it
"31/07/2021, 09:51",Nagaraju,Just a question
"31/07/2021, 09:53",Janhavi,"Actually,  he expected that the model would be something like a ""One to many"" sort of architecture where output should be the best indian squad"
"31/07/2021, 09:54",Nagaraju,One more thing we can do is
"31/07/2021, 09:54",Nagaraju,And give more weight to performance on those pitches?
"31/07/2021, 09:55",Nagaraju,We can also attach some weight to age of player
"31/07/2021, 09:55",Nagaraju,How many times he got injured in the last season
"31/07/2021, 09:55",Nagaraju,Etc
"31/07/2021, 09:55",Janhavi,"So, random forest could work well right, where when we column sample some of the features we can always include the features of the best players for each of the ""m"" models ??"
"31/07/2021, 09:55",Nagaraju,This is for the featurization
"31/07/2021, 09:56",Janhavi,Yes 👍👍 💯
"31/07/2021, 09:57",Nagaraju,Actually I want led to ask one thing to everyone in the group
"31/07/2021, 09:57",Nagaraju,It's quite interesting
"31/07/2021, 09:58",Nagaraju,The way I would do is
"31/07/2021, 09:58",Nagaraju,It's sort of naïve but
"31/07/2021, 09:59",Nagaraju,Can someone help me understand how to pose this as a classification problem
"31/07/2021, 09:59",Janhavi,"If its kinda classification problem,  then it should be a multilabel classification right"
"31/07/2021, 10:05",Janhavi,Yea this is what even I told..
"31/07/2021, 10:10",Silam,If this cricket sqaud will be soved as regression problem then what will be the target variable. What we will try minimise???
"31/07/2021, 10:15",Janhavi,"If 15 players are selected in a squad then, there will be batsman,bowlers &  wicket keepers right --> So, we can come up with some custom target variables like cumulative scores of each player based on the feedback given by their coaches or scrape some interesting stat from BCCI website or Cricbuzz.com something like that😌"
"31/07/2021, 10:59",Sherya,Yup
"31/07/2021, 10:59",Sherya,That is how we find the top features in a random forest model
"31/07/2021, 11:00",Sherya,"If a particular feature is important in all base learners, then it's important for the random forest model also"
"31/07/2021, 11:04",Sherya,Forward feature selection and backward feature selection also work on similar lines not exactly same. I might be wrong though. It's worth experimenting :)
"31/07/2021, 11:06",Rohit,"Okay, i'll try this"
"31/07/2021, 11:56",Silam,"Hey your question is not exactly but similar to to movie ""Moneyball"" where the general manger of the team hired a statistc graduate to form a baseball team of underrated players."
"31/07/2021, 11:57",Silam,Maybe there will be articles on internet how did they do it.
"31/07/2021, 12:12",Janhavi,Oh..k..nice...let me see

Why do we manually try to find the best single parameter (e.g. 'Best learning rate' in the facebook recommendation assignment) for all the parameters and then again go for RandomizedSearchCV? Why isn't the latter enough? What is the use of executing via both methods? Thank you"

"02/08/2021, 14:31",Priyanshi,"Yes it's not very useful. In my experience on avg you need 2.5x time for taking notes, understanding the concept."
"02/08/2021, 14:33",Vinay,Yes very true and if you start reading comments it will bring more frustration…
"02/08/2021, 14:41",Hayat,True I have experience the same..sometimes if becomes frustrating when you are not aligned with the schedule.
"02/08/2021, 14:44",Hayat,But it also provides us with the beach mark to follow and stay consistent.

"05/08/2021, 11:24",Silam,Yes
"05/08/2021, 11:26",Silam,Tfidf vectorizer returns sparse matrix which requires sparse.hstack but w2v returns a dense matrix so it requires np.hstack.
"05/08/2021, 11:26",Suryansh,you're right
"05/08/2021, 11:26",Suryansh,it worked. we don't need to add .tocsr() at the end of np.hstack

"05/08/2021, 20:16",Priyanshi,If we are trying to predict 7th day price based on time series data we basically shift target variable by 7 rows upwards thus for current day target variable will be 7th day price.

"05/08/2021, 21:09",Priyanshi,Same values as last value?
"05/08/2021, 21:09",Rohit,yes
"05/08/2021, 21:11",Priyanshi,But it will be misleading for model as I also have to predict for 90th day
"05/08/2021, 21:16",Rohit,"sorry I didn't get 90th day, this will happen for any offset #of rows.Other techniques such as mean, median can also be used but since it is a time series dataforward /backward fill will be more appropriate as it values will most match using these"
"05/08/2021, 21:19",Priyanshi,I meant for the last n day period say 90 it will be a flat line.
"05/08/2021, 21:22",Rohit,yes it will flat for offset #rows

"11/08/2021, 18:55",Sherya,Okay cool
"11/08/2021, 18:56",Sherya,Also I have 5 months left. How much time will it take on average to do 3 case studies?
"11/08/2021, 19:08",Ganesh,"First finish deep learning Assigns, then you will understand. Not less than 20 days for case study as per my understanding."
"11/08/2021, 19:08",Rounak,For each case study ?? @917904411278
"11/08/2021, 19:09",Ganesh,"Yeah, if you do it properly, without copying any readymade case studies."
"11/08/2021, 19:15",Sherya,Okay thanks :)

"13/08/2021, 15:04",Priyanka,Your last *elif* is wrong... condition for *fp* should be like y=0 and pred_class=1:

"13/08/2021, 15:52",Aadesh,"Also, this part is explained well in the lecture it self. I suggest you re-watch the lecture."
"13/08/2021, 15:52",Mahendra,this is same problem in code of auc score
"13/08/2021, 15:53",Aadesh,Here you are getting division zero error. So check  what is denominator. It's fp and tn. So print fp and tn values. And check what is happening
"13/08/2021, 15:54",Mahendra,i watched but from scratch and from sklearn i found different values of auc score
"13/08/2021, 15:54",Aadesh,Division zero meaning number is divided by zero.
"13/08/2021, 15:55",Mahendra,thats why i want code
"13/08/2021, 15:56",Mahendra,tpr = tp/(tp+fn)
"13/08/2021, 15:56",Mahendra,after this i get error
"13/08/2021, 15:57",Aadesh,Put your print statements here to print the denominator. Before the calculation
"13/08/2021, 16:10",Nav,"1) Probably your fp and tn both are 0. Print and check all the values of tp, fp, tn, fn if they are making sense or not."

"17/08/2021, 16:23",Krishna,They need mathematics
"17/08/2021, 16:25",Namita,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26355942/why-is-the-f-measure-a-harmonic-mean-and-not-an-arithmetic-mean-of-the-precision
"17/08/2021, 16:25",Priti,We use the harmonic mean instead of a simple average because it punishes extreme values. A classifier with a precision of 1.0 and a recall of 0.0 has a simple average of 0.5 but an F1 score of 0. The F1 score gives equal weight to both measures and is a specific example of the general Fβ metric where β can be adjusted to give more weight to either recall or precision.

"17/08/2021, 18:40",Nav,you need to pass pd.read_csv(filepath) to pass filepath as a variable that you've defined above

"18/08/2021, 11:26",Guru,"IN TRANSFER LEARNING ASSIGNMENT, how to add more layers on top of predefined architect of vgg16, without using sequential api"
"18/08/2021, 12:44",Kush,It's correct.. Same I had few days back
"18/08/2021, 12:56",Nav,"I haven't done this assignment yet but since I have done this kind of work so I can share my views. After making layers.trainable = False in the vgg16 architecture. Define an x = vgg16.output, then simply use the functonal api to stack one layer over the other like x = Dense(units)(x) here the input will be x = vgg16.output"
"18/08/2021, 13:02",Nav,OR you can do this too
"18/08/2021, 13:03",Nav,"ignore the ""x = GlobalAveragePool"" at the end"

"20/08/2021, 09:13",Nagaraju,Check out case study on Amazon product record
"20/08/2021, 09:13",Nagaraju,Recommendation*
"20/08/2021, 09:13",Nagaraju,You can try your own
"20/08/2021, 13:33",Ranjit,Can we monetize our medium articles?
"20/08/2021, 13:39",Sukh,My plan is to go for masters abroad next year in data science
"20/08/2021, 13:40",Nav,"Better contact any professors from reputed institutions. Check their h index if possible, check the kind of research they are doing, and start working with them. Try to get your paper published(this holds a lot of value)"
"20/08/2021, 13:41",Nav,"Especially if your paper gets published in reputed conferences like maybe grade A*, A or even B, your application will hold a lot of value cuz it's a proof that you can do research."
"20/08/2021, 16:04",Karan,Why do you want to take pg diploma and then masters ?
"20/08/2021, 16:04",Karan,True!
"20/08/2021, 16:13",Raju,So that masters might be a smother sailing I guess
"20/08/2021, 16:23",Karan,Ok👍🏻
"20/08/2021, 16:23",Jyoti,For knowledge he can also learn from edx coursera kind of courses
"20/08/2021, 16:24",Karan,I don't think pg diploma will add value to masters admit ?
"20/08/2021, 16:24",Karan,If that is the case
"20/08/2021, 16:25",Jyoti,"Don't do pg diploma if ur sure of doing masters,  if u want real time learning and experience learn from free edx coursera courses and do internship"
"20/08/2021, 16:25",Karan,Same feeling....
"20/08/2021, 16:25",Jyoti,Ineuron has launched  internships across all data profiles
"20/08/2021, 16:26",Jyoti,If it's a thesis based masters then ur research exposure and publications matters
"20/08/2021, 16:26",Karan,True!
"20/08/2021, 16:31",Nav,Better try for a integrated PhD abroad and then work at Google Brain 😂😂😂
"20/08/2021, 16:34",Sukh,Considering the diploma because my Cgpa ain't that great in bachelors😅
"20/08/2021, 16:36",Nav,"Yeah this is in case you need to be funded by a professor, mostly in countries like Canada where the professor himself has a lot of say in your admission. He/she needs proof of your ability to perform research or else it's his/her loss at funding you. In case of the taught programs too obviously having papers published gives a better edge at admission. But yeah I think NPTEL, edx (ones by MITx) ones are better than Coursera considering the rigour. As for CGPA, it can be overlooked if you have a good SOP, LoRs. Try for a 320+ in GRE as well"
"20/08/2021, 16:38",Nav,"Just that thesis based master's become difficult to get admitted into if you don't have a good cgpa, but it doesn't seem like you are interested in a thesis based master's."
"20/08/2021, 16:42",Sukh,Yeah to be honest I'm more inclined towards working in the industry
"20/08/2021, 16:45",Nav,Then I think you should do internships and end-to-end projects
"20/08/2021, 17:00",Karan,+ Try to get into analytics based firms for internship or full time jobs
"20/08/2021, 17:24",Shradha,Not in india due to payment channel issues
"20/08/2021, 17:41",Jyoti,In UK and Europe the data science masters course duration is 1 year and fees is less

"20/08/2021, 18:08",Ranjit,Scaling keeps that thing intact ..it will give higher number to outlier n as compared to that data very less number will be given to rest data
"20/08/2021, 18:09",Ranjit,As mean of whole data will be on higher end only .i mean towards outlier only so i don't think there willbe any issue

"21/08/2021, 12:22",Kush,I took 50 threshold values and it's getting calculated in 0.0000 seconds

"21/08/2021, 12:25",Kush,AUC doesn't change much if we take 50 or 100
"21/08/2021, 12:25",Kush,What value of n you have taken?
"21/08/2021, 12:26",Jas,A very big number😅

"27/08/2021, 19:42",Raghvendra,How much time did it took for you to process 2000  byte files .
"27/08/2021, 19:44",Priyanka,1 hr 10 min
"27/08/2021, 19:44",Priyanka,On an avg
"27/08/2021, 19:44",Priyanka,For each
"27/08/2021, 19:45",Priyanka,2000 byte file
"27/08/2021, 19:46",Raghvendra,Are  you using colab ?
"27/08/2021, 19:46",Priyanka,Yup
"27/08/2021, 19:46",Priyanka,Colab only
"27/08/2021, 19:50",Raghvendra,Thank you. I am using local environment it taking so much time more .have you uploaded the entire train data and then unzip  in colab?
"27/08/2021, 19:52",Priyanka,"I unzip the train data on my laptop only, then separated bytefiles from asm files using jupyter notebook"
"27/08/2021, 19:53",Priyanka,then uploaded bytefile and asm file folder on my google drive
"27/08/2021, 19:53",Priyanka,after that i started doing on colab
"27/08/2021, 19:57",Raghvendra,So 200 gb you  uploaded to Google Drive. How much time it took. Actually I am working on this assignment from last 10 days but    due issues I am  processing multiple times.
"27/08/2021, 19:58",Priyanka,bro I had space on my google drive thats why uploaded all the data
"27/08/2021, 19:58",Priyanka,but what u can do is upload only those 2000 bytefiles
"27/08/2021, 19:58",Priyanka,for which u r going create features
"27/08/2021, 19:59",Priyanka,"once done,then u could store those features in drive"
"27/08/2021, 19:59",Priyanka,then delete those bytefiles once they are used
"27/08/2021, 19:59",Priyanka,then again repeate the process
"27/08/2021, 20:01",Raghvendra,Thank you bro for the suggestion.
"27/08/2021, 20:02",Priyanka,bro iam from non CS background I know the struggle🤦‍♂️
"27/08/2021, 20:02",Priyanka,i can feel for u
"27/08/2021, 20:08",Priyanshi,I will tell you a  way which  worked for me.
"27/08/2021, 20:16",Raghvendra,Thank you rohan for the detailed info. How much it costs for the google  Drive space?
"27/08/2021, 20:17",Priyanshi,Not much
"27/08/2021, 20:36",Raghvendra,ok thank you rohan
"27/08/2021, 20:58",Virat,How much time did Imagegenerator took in transfer learning assignment in colab???
"27/08/2021, 20:59",Virat,For me it is almost 1hr 50min
"27/08/2021, 20:59",Ashish,Hi.

"28/08/2021, 00:32",Abhinav,Yes same here any suggestions????
"28/08/2021, 06:17",Priyanshi,Use !wget or kaggle command to download data directly on colab hosted drive and then run imagenet generator.
"28/08/2021, 14:09",Varun,after how many assignment completion AAIC provide mentor??
"28/08/2021, 14:24",Priyanshi,For case study they provide mentor
"28/08/2021, 14:24",Krishna,Why do u need mentor instead of google search
"28/08/2021, 14:25",Krishna,What mentor will do. Is he better than google search?
"28/08/2021, 14:25",Krishna,Does he knows better than frameworks docs
"28/08/2021, 14:26",Krishna,"If you realise, understand by using simple stuff that available. No need any person to help I think"
"28/08/2021, 14:31",Priyanshi,Yeah agreed. Anyways mentor doesn't help you for coding stuff.
"28/08/2021, 15:18",Karam,"Mentor will give you the right direction, as such your Google searching will be more effective I think👌"
"28/08/2021, 16:02",Janhavi,💯

"28/08/2021, 21:38",Jas,Okay
"28/08/2021, 22:33",Priya,Has anyone used any software to transform Matlab codes to python codes?
"28/08/2021, 23:26",Om,"Does anyone knows in which case study, forward/backward feature selection has been used..?"
"29/08/2021, 15:48",Ashish,"Hi. Has anyone worked or is working on recommendation systems? I researched on which performance metric to use for evaluation and its suggested to use F1-score. But I have no ground truth, so cant use F1 score. Any suggestions on an alternative metric would be helpful."
"29/08/2021, 15:49",Priya,Ground truth is in your user-item matrix...
"29/08/2021, 15:50",Priya,You can do kfold testing
"29/08/2021, 15:51",Priya,It basically picks submatrices and test other matrices.
"29/08/2021, 15:51",Ashish,Thank you 👍🏻

"29/08/2021, 19:11",Priyanka,Currently iam doing that only
"29/08/2021, 19:11",Priyanka,2 hrs + and it is still
"29/08/2021, 19:11",Priyanka,Going on
"29/08/2021, 19:12",Priyanka,I think mine will be done in 2.5 hrs
"29/08/2021, 19:41",Suryansh,i’m 3 hours down
"29/08/2021, 20:39",Priyanshi,Show your code
"30/08/2021, 10:04",Suryansh,did you get it done
"30/08/2021, 10:04",Suryansh,yes will do
"30/08/2021, 10:05",Priyanka,Yeah it was done

"01/09/2021, 12:30",Mony,What's the value you r getting?
"01/09/2021, 12:30",Suryansh,nothing. it’s been running since forever
"01/09/2021, 12:31",Suryansh,i think i need a list as an output but the grader function doesn’t seem to suggest that so i’m confused
"01/09/2021, 12:36",Mony,Output should be a fp number. I guess problem is in loop if it is running for long.
"01/09/2021, 12:36",Suryansh,fp number?
"01/09/2021, 12:36",Mony,Float value
"01/09/2021, 12:36",Priyanshi,you're saying for value in:
"01/09/2021, 12:36",Priyanshi,variable*
"01/09/2021, 12:37",Priyanshi,and what's data
"01/09/2021, 12:38",Suryansh,not referring that. just want to iterate those many times
"01/09/2021, 12:39",Suryansh,the csv file provided
"01/09/2021, 12:39",Priyanshi,no you have to calculate it only for user_id provided in input function
"01/09/2021, 12:39",Priyanshi,For example first part should be like 2*alpha*b_i[user_id]
"01/09/2021, 12:39",Suryansh,ohh but what about the summation
"01/09/2021, 12:40",Priyanshi,ignore summmation
"01/09/2021, 12:41",Suryansh,ohhhhh right right i’m trying it out
"01/09/2021, 12:42",Priyanshi,Here basically you're trying to learn user and movie specific biases.
"01/09/2021, 12:42",Priyanshi,with using SGD
"01/09/2021, 12:42",Suryansh,yes
"01/09/2021, 12:43",Suryansh,same for the second term right
"01/09/2021, 13:19",Suryansh,<Media omitted>
"01/09/2021, 13:28",Priyanshi,U[user_id] same for V

"02/09/2021, 12:42",Karam,Let me see if I can optimize my code further
"02/09/2021, 13:39",Mony,"What does status ""done plagiarised"" mean??"
"02/09/2021, 13:39",Mony,in applied ai assignments
"02/09/2021, 13:41",Suryansh,wow didn’t know they gave that too. you got it?
"02/09/2021, 13:42",Mony,"Earlier they marked it plagiarised, after I explained them, they changed it to done plagiarised as I have used code mentioned in their notebook only."
"02/09/2021, 13:43",Suryansh,and then did you ask them what it meant
"02/09/2021, 13:43",Mony,"I mailed them, yet to receive their response"
"02/09/2021, 13:47",Suryansh,yes ask them to get it back to done
"02/09/2021, 13:48",Suryansh,i think they said they’ll nullify the assignment if it’s plagiarised so you should get it done quick
"02/09/2021, 13:49",Mony,"Yes, waiting for their response and in the assignment section, they mentioned ""assignment is accepted""."
"02/09/2021, 13:51",Anmol,It means you have used code
"02/09/2021, 13:51",Anmol,Copied from somebody or website
"02/09/2021, 13:51",Anmol,You should use comments to explain code if used from sources

"02/09/2021, 15:21",Karam,Thanks man
"02/09/2021, 15:22",Raju,It depends you can create list as well if you want but it can be done with a simple scalar value with some comparisons(if-else) in a loop
"02/09/2021, 15:23",Raju,Or 2 loops maybe

"03/09/2021, 16:43",Ganesh,What suggestion you need?
"03/09/2021, 16:45",Guru,which pretrained model will work well?
"03/09/2021, 16:45",Ganesh,Unet worked well.
"03/09/2021, 16:46",Ganesh,From the library of Segmentation_models
"03/09/2021, 16:46",Guru,"ohkay, got it"
"03/09/2021, 16:46",Guru,Thanks brother😁
"03/09/2021, 18:02",Abhinav,What is the best way to share assignment in resume?
"03/09/2021, 18:02",Krishan,Use encoding='cp1252' as given in the case study
"03/09/2021, 18:03",Guru,"upload it into your github, and share ur GitHub link"
"03/09/2021, 18:13",Rohit,"But uploading assignment is not advisable, I guess"
"03/09/2021, 18:14",Abhinav,Even for internship is not advisable?
"03/09/2021, 18:15",Raju,You can make repo private and share your repo link
"03/09/2021, 18:15",Raju,One why
"03/09/2021, 18:22",Paridhi,I'm getting this error :

"04/09/2021, 15:22",Om,Anyone working as data scientist or given interview at Flipkart or ola
"04/09/2021, 15:28",Ritik,According to your budget try the highest RAM configuration possible

"04/09/2021, 17:35",Sherya,It's just out of curiosity. Has anyone been placed to a company via Applied AI?
"04/09/2021, 17:39",Gagan,Is it possible to extend our validity time?
"04/09/2021, 17:41",Namita,Tuff and most controversial question 😅
"04/09/2021, 17:48",Priyanka,I too have same question
"04/09/2021, 17:49",Sherya,Yes. I think you have to pay 17-18k to extend
"04/09/2021, 17:49",Ritik,I think but you will have to pay
"04/09/2021, 17:50",Krishna,May be 60% f original fee
"04/09/2021, 17:55",Sachin,"Give some valid reason, about your profession or srudent.. One of my friends got two months extension, after giving valid reasons... They will give extension for 2-3  months.."
"04/09/2021, 17:58",Namita,They can extend up-to 2 months for free( for valid reason ) after that u need to pay 60% of course fee
"04/09/2021, 18:20",Gagan,Thank you
"04/09/2021, 18:23",Sukh,"The bitter truth is any institute which promises placements is a scam, a lost of courses fall into this category"
"04/09/2021, 18:23",Sherya,True. Content is top notch
"04/09/2021, 18:24",Sherya,Problem is getting interview calls 😂
"04/09/2021, 18:26",Namita,Exactly
"04/09/2021, 18:36",Paridhi,That's actually motivation.. When you get placement notification mail and then you check the eligibility.... It works as a energy booster😂
"04/09/2021, 18:54",Naveen,The course content will work only if u get calls for interview..otherwise people are also getting calls after completing Udemy courses too
"04/09/2021, 18:55",Ritik,But still if you are eligible for cash back program isn't worth it?
"04/09/2021, 18:59",Sukh,Which Udemy course is that bro😂
"04/09/2021, 19:00",Naveen,Yea that's what I am talking qbout
"04/09/2021, 19:00",Naveen,Getting calls is the hard part
"04/09/2021, 19:02",Namita,Problem is most of the companies are looking for relavent  experience but without job how gonna v get experience 😆
"04/09/2021, 19:04",Prajwal,Completely agree and thing is that the number of job postings through appliedAI is very less but there are so many students who are enrolling into applied AI course..
"04/09/2021, 19:05",Naveen,There are terms and conditions for cashback program....there are 30 assignments...these are not simply import xgboost then fit it..
"04/09/2021, 19:06",Namita,That's the catch at end of day applied AI is business if you get placed u r lucky else u vl get money back and job gaurentee is just to attract audience
"04/09/2021, 19:07",Naveen,May be internship can help regarding this...
"04/09/2021, 19:08",Parul,Also one thing i noticed is the companies which come are usually from south side
"04/09/2021, 19:08",Parul,And mostly startup kinds
"04/09/2021, 19:09",Parul,I did not come across companies based from Mumbai or some MNC
"04/09/2021, 19:09",Naveen,😂😂 that's where the founders are from..south or north as long as u get placements it's fine
"04/09/2021, 19:30",Jyoti,"Better not to depend on applied ai  for placements, finish all content do the assignment and be active in LinkedIn share ur work and apply as much as possible."
"04/09/2021, 19:32",Priyanshi,Yes agreed.

"04/09/2021, 23:45",Raju,True that's why we should think about global market
"04/09/2021, 23:46",Raju,So many indian products have higher demands outside India as compared to demand in india
"04/09/2021, 23:46",Raju,Funding options will be increased too
"04/09/2021, 23:46",Raju,I know its easy to say

"04/09/2021, 23:47",Raju,But people are doing this shit and so should we
"04/09/2021, 23:48",Raju,That's some time in future apart from self driving cars
"04/09/2021, 23:48",Raju,There should be application
"04/09/2021, 23:49",Raju,We should brain storm ideas here
"04/09/2021, 23:49",Raju,Or maybe
"04/09/2021, 23:49",Raju,Not all people in this group might be interested in that
"04/09/2021, 23:50",Raju,So we can create different group

"04/09/2021, 23:51",Aniket,Something for middle class could afford and simply and neat ideas... bcz people usually bring up weird ideas .... there is a difference between illogical and out of box

"05/09/2021, 15:48",Sukh,Anyone done with Behaviour of linear models assignment?
"05/09/2021, 15:49",Abhinav,SGD classifier with logloss itself logistic regression
"05/09/2021, 15:50",Yogesh,No
"05/09/2021, 15:50",Abhinav,I think both are same
"05/09/2021, 15:50",Abhinav,How did you conclude that?
"05/09/2021, 15:51",Raju,SGD classifier is a algo to minimize loss
"05/09/2021, 15:51",Yogesh,Yes
"05/09/2021, 15:51",Raju,Depending on loss function used it's either logistic regression or svm or etc depending on loss function
"05/09/2021, 15:52",Raju,These implementation should be same internally
"05/09/2021, 15:53",Raju,But using SGD classifier and passing the loss function gives the flexibility to change from one algo to other quickly
"05/09/2021, 15:53",Raju,With change of loss fnct
"05/09/2021, 15:53",Raju,I too think they both should have similar implementation internally
"05/09/2021, 15:55",Abhinav,Yes only difference is regularisation term is inversely proportional. Otherwise all are same
"05/09/2021, 15:56",Janhavi,Sgd classifier uses log loss
"05/09/2021, 15:56",Suryansh,don’t we arrive at the same result either way

"05/09/2021, 16:40",Silam,"SGD is a optimization method, while Logistic Regression (LR) is a machine learning algorithm/model. You can think of that a machine learning model defines a loss function, and the optimization method minimizes/maximizes it."
"05/09/2021, 18:01",Manisha,Any one has experience of mock exam of applied ai???
"05/09/2021, 18:49",Janhavi,For which tasks we will use stemming & for which tasks we will use lemmatization?
"05/09/2021, 19:06",Raju,"Both are used to find stem words, but stem words found from lemmatization has to make sense like it has to be a word in English language which is not necessary in stemming."
"05/09/2021, 19:07",Raju,So you can decide accordingly
"05/09/2021, 19:08",Raju,This message was deleted
"05/09/2021, 19:08",Raju,Apart from that both have similar results
"05/09/2021, 19:08",Janhavi,"Yeah..ok so may I know which is more preferable or suitable for the following cases,"
"05/09/2021, 19:13",Raju,for l anguage translation and question answering (considering time requirements are tight - even Milliseconds matter ) you can go with lemmatization
"05/09/2021, 19:14",Raju,If no such conditions or some relaxed task like auto completion either of them can be used
"05/09/2021, 19:16",Raju,"If anyone has done some work or Some tasks like chat bots or so, do suggest him"

"07/09/2021, 09:24",Priyanshi,If you're confident about conceptual understanding you can but you should show some projects on your resume.
"07/09/2021, 09:25",Pinky,Okay. The main reason is that I have wasted a lot of time. So I'm planning to complete this course and get a job asap.
"07/09/2021, 09:27",Abhinav,I have applied for the job after completing all the ml assignment but it is time waste. No response from recruiters due to lack project

"08/09/2021, 07:07",Priyanka,how to decrease the test time complexity of a logistic regression model?
"08/09/2021, 07:07",Priyanka,anyone?
"08/09/2021, 07:13",Yogesh,use L1 regularization
"08/09/2021, 07:13",Yogesh,hence non important features weight becomes 0
"08/09/2021, 07:13",Yogesh,Then for only important features weight will be computed
"08/09/2021, 07:14",Yogesh,see if you have 1000 features hence 1000 weights
"08/09/2021, 07:14",Yogesh,but if only 100 featueres are important
"08/09/2021, 07:14",Yogesh,then remaining 900 features weight will become 0
"08/09/2021, 07:14",Yogesh,hence while real time
"08/09/2021, 07:15",Yogesh,only those 100 weights will be used

"08/09/2021, 18:30",Nav,Thats indirectly using SGd
"08/09/2021, 18:30",Nav,Can be used anywhere we need to optimize right
"08/09/2021, 18:33",Sherya,Yup we can use SGD to optimize any function that is differentiable
"08/09/2021, 18:34",Sherya,"For Matrix Factorization, we do have to minimize a loss function i.e (Aij-(Bi.T * Cj))**2 should be minimum"
"08/09/2021, 19:55",Paridhi,<Media omitted>
"08/09/2021, 20:11",Nav,"No no i am saying that sgd or adagrad or adam or whatever you use for minimizing the loss. But the dimensionality reduction is not being done by the optimizer, right? Its being done by matrix factorization"
"08/09/2021, 20:11",Sherya,How would you factorize a matrix?
"08/09/2021, 20:13",Paridhi,I am getting the fig only in horizantal not on vertical though i have mentioned both x and y points
"08/09/2021, 20:17",Nav,Factorize the original matrix into a product of two matrices(which are basically the lower dimensional representations) using singular value decomposition. Then reduce the loss between original matrix and the product of the two matrices using any optimizer. Am I right?

"09/09/2021, 11:33",Rohan,Why are we normalizing the numerical feature say price in donors choose database?
"09/09/2021, 11:34",Rohan,"Normalizing all the features wrt to train data, what help do we get from this?"
"09/09/2021, 11:36",Raju,"Better understanding for humans, and after normalising even if scale changes it will dot effect the performance"
"09/09/2021, 11:42",Rohan,Why not standardization?
"09/09/2021, 11:44",Rohan,Standardization only to be used for gaussian distribution 🤔
"09/09/2021, 11:45",Raju,"Depends on features so , probably aiic wanted those features to be in a certain range"
"09/09/2021, 11:46",Raju,Normalisation have a bounding range right
"09/09/2021, 11:46",Rohan,"Yes [-1,1] or [0,1]"
"09/09/2021, 11:47",Nav,Scaling of numerical features totally depends on your problem statement. It's like you can't be sure that normalization performs a better job than standardization. It's kind of a trial and error thing
"09/09/2021, 11:47",Raju,Agree
"09/09/2021, 11:47",Rohan,Yeah
"09/09/2021, 11:49",Nav,Actually check out sklearn's documentation on scaling. They have explained all the available scalers with examples and code

"09/09/2021, 16:30",Paridhi,See sign then comes submission
"09/09/2021, 16:31",Paridhi,What does sign represent?
"09/09/2021, 16:33",Shantanu,That function is your decision function at the test time.

"09/09/2021, 23:21",Silam,You need to apply sigmoid function on it to get the probability values.
"09/09/2021, 23:23",Karan,Like applying sigmoid function on y after getting the y values using the equation? Is it
"09/09/2021, 23:34",Silam,When you run your SGD let for your 1st epoch you will an updated w and b. Now you have to calculate logloss for this w and b to check they reduce the logloss or not. Now to calculate logloss you need y_actual and y_pred. But you don't have y_pred values.

"12/09/2021, 14:48",Gagan,Hii From my understanding of your code you are taking loss at each epoch and appending to a loss list and you are doing it till the end of all epoch....
"12/09/2021, 15:02",Karan,"Ohkay taking difference seems good idea. But my question is, is the test loss meant to increase till the end from 1st epoch to 50th one. 😅😅"

"17/09/2021, 21:34",Paridhi,I have spent 3 to 4 days just on it...so then did only 2 for each set no hyperparameter was used it is marked as evaluated
"17/09/2021, 21:35",Paridhi,So now it's better to know from exp people which might be the best option
"17/09/2021, 21:37",Paridhi,And is there any way i can run only the cells i want to correct instead of running all the cells right from the start?

"18/09/2021, 16:48",Abhinav,Epcoh increase loss decrease it is good
"18/09/2021, 16:49",Abhinav,It should differs by atleast 10 power -2
"18/09/2021, 16:49",Rohan,Difference should be in 10^-3
"18/09/2021, 16:50",Shradha,"Actually, loss only decreased for epoch 0-2 and then it increases and stays almost constant in my case"
"18/09/2021, 16:50",Shradha,Yes I'm not able to figure out what am I doing wrong
"18/09/2021, 16:51",Abhinav,Show update rule code
"18/09/2021, 16:51",Rohan,Have u used tol =10^-4
"18/09/2021, 16:51",Shradha,<Media omitted>
"18/09/2021, 16:52",Shradha,"no, actually it was not mentioned in assignment. can you throw some light on what is that and how to use it"
"18/09/2021, 16:52",Abhinav,X_train is dataframe?
"18/09/2021, 16:53",Abhinav,If it is dataframe use x_train.iloc[i]
"18/09/2021, 16:53",Abhinav,Also check your dw function
"18/09/2021, 16:54",Shradha,No it's numpy array
"18/09/2021, 16:54",Rohan,"Tol is difference in the successive test loss , code execution will stop when successive test loss is less tha 10^-4 ...Indicating that our solution has converged"
"18/09/2021, 16:55",Shradha,"The grader function returned true for it, so that should be correct?"
"18/09/2021, 16:55",Seeta,What I see b = b + db and use should use tolerance
"18/09/2021, 16:56",Shradha,"Oh yes, that's a mistake. Thanks for pointing"
"18/09/2021, 16:56",Rohan,Yes
"18/09/2021, 16:57",Abhinav,Some we have to check
"18/09/2021, 17:01",Shradha,Oh thanks. I used dot instead of multiply and now I'm getting right results. Thank you very much 🙌🏻 ✨
"18/09/2021, 17:05",Shradha,<Media omitted>
"18/09/2021, 17:06",Shradha,adding tolerance would help now?
"18/09/2021, 17:08",Rohan,I had this problem while doing  when tol=10^-5 it was not converging but converged when tol = 10^-4 .
"18/09/2021, 17:09",Rohan,Yes
"18/09/2021, 17:12",Shradha,if len(train_losses)>2:
"18/09/2021, 17:13",Shradha,"I wrote this for tolerance, but not observing difference for 3, 4 and 5 decimal places"
"18/09/2021, 17:15",Shradha,"it compares if upto 4 digit decimal of current train loss and previous train loss are same, then return w, b"
"18/09/2021, 17:22",Rohan,How much is eta0
"18/09/2021, 17:23",Shradha,eta0 is 0.0001
"18/09/2021, 17:23",Shradha,This must be wrong in some way right
"18/09/2021, 17:24",Rohan,Nope don't think so
"18/09/2021, 17:24",Rohan,Try and tweak eta and observe if any changes
"18/09/2021, 17:25",Shradha,"but the sklearn implementation has same eta0, alpha and tol"
"18/09/2021, 17:25",Shradha,changing it would not be allowed i guess
"18/09/2021, 17:26",Rohan,Yes just for testing
"18/09/2021, 17:26",Shradha,oh okay
"18/09/2021, 17:30",Rohan,w and b need to update outside the for loop
"18/09/2021, 17:32",Shradha,"but that for loop is only there to update w and b, if i remove it out, w and b will be updated for only last datapoint"
"18/09/2021, 17:33",Shradha,which can be done without iterating in range(lene(X_train))
"18/09/2021, 17:34",Rohan,Inside the loop dw = dw + gradient for that point
"18/09/2021, 17:36",Shradha,<Media omitted>
"18/09/2021, 17:38",Shradha,i'll try this

"18/09/2021, 17:41",Shradha,<Media omitted>
"18/09/2021, 17:42",Shradha,(t) is there right. it's the index no
"18/09/2021, 17:43",Shradha,I think there would be summation in the last equation if it had to be cumulative of all dws
"18/09/2021, 17:43",Rohan,"in video also they mentioned they are averaging the gradient vector for N data points, while deriving  and then updating"
"18/09/2021, 17:44",Rohan,see their is lambda / N term in grad_w formula
"18/09/2021, 17:48",Shradha,<Media omitted>
"18/09/2021, 17:52",Rohan,Okay...Go through derivation once again and check 👍

"18/09/2021, 17:58",Shradha,@917083496620 is this code correct?

"18/09/2021, 18:22",Raghvendra,<Media omitted>
"18/09/2021, 18:26",Abhinav,Is these weight are closer to input?

"27/09/2021, 09:55",Priyanka,"@919892765539 class_weight = balanced, there is one parameter, is that sufficient for balancing or anything else needs to be done?"

"27/09/2021, 10:00",Priyanka,"okay, but there is nothing as such hyper-parameter in GBDT classifier"
"27/09/2021, 10:00",Priyanka,it is only in DecisionTree classifier
"27/09/2021, 10:01",Sherya,Use lightgbm
"27/09/2021, 10:02",Priyanka,and what all hyper-parameters you have passed in GridSearch cv in GBDT

"29/09/2021, 13:44",Rohan,Don't use max depth it is not very useful in GBDT....Base learners should be high bias model of shallow depth
"29/09/2021, 13:44",Rohan,Instead u can use learning rate...Shrinkage
"29/09/2021, 13:45",Priyanka,What should be range for this one
"29/09/2021, 13:45",Priyanka,I left that default value
"29/09/2021, 13:45",Rohan,I used max depth as 3
"29/09/2021, 13:46",Priyanka,Also min_sample_split can be tuned?

"02/10/2021, 14:44",Bavya,Hi quick question on decision trees assignment 9. Do we need to do one hot encoding for categorical features? Since only 5000 rows dataset and decision tree can work with categories do we need to do one hot encoding for them?
"02/10/2021, 14:52",Ninad,Not required in Decision Tree or related algorithms
"02/10/2021, 14:55",Bavya,"I thought the same , in the assignment instruction video though the lady mention perform encodin on categorical features and I am doubtful now"
"02/10/2021, 14:57",Ninad,"yeah, good point."
"02/10/2021, 14:57",Shradha,"Yes, StandardScalar() is a class which has functions like fit, transform, fit_transform (and obviously __init__ to intialize objects with some variables)"

"02/10/2021, 19:43",Sherya,"Depends on what you will use image captioning for. Based on the core business problem, you need to decide what you need to decrease FN, FP or both."
"02/10/2021, 19:44",Sherya,This will hep you choose the apt business metric.
"02/10/2021, 19:51",Manisha,"Based on loss function, we adjust our weights..."
"02/10/2021, 19:54",Akshath,Yeah right
"02/10/2021, 20:05",Manisha,"First, we initialize weight randomly.. And based on that we calculate loss function. Once we calculate loss then we need to minimize loss by adjusting its weight."

"05/10/2021, 08:25",Suryansh,hi. anybody completed callback assignment? could use some tips
"05/10/2021, 11:36",Pragya,Hi
"05/10/2021, 11:43",Rahul,what's  the issue
"05/10/2021, 11:48",Bavya,"For getting feature importance in decision trees, why is it advised in the assignment to set Max depth to none.. I guess we will get fully developed tress with single leaflets, that actually causes over fitting in decion tree algorithm though"
"05/10/2021, 15:32",Priyanka,"DenseNets-dense connectivity pattern is that it requires fewer parameters than traditional convolutional networks, as there is no need to relearn redundant feature-maps."
"05/10/2021, 15:32",Priyanka,Can anyone explain this?
"05/10/2021, 20:44",Abhinav,Using concatenation we are using feature map from all the previous layers.
"05/10/2021, 20:45",Abhinav,This is the reason for low parameters
"05/10/2021, 22:30",Shankar,Can someone share the implementation of response encoding using classes (in GBDT assignment)

"07/10/2021, 00:31",Ninad,in reference notebook

"07/10/2021, 21:57",Priyanshi,1st approach is good. It will barely take 5 minutes for whole operation
"07/10/2021, 21:59",Om,Anyone recently given in any interview for data science domain role ?
"07/10/2021, 22:03",Namita,Yup I gave couple of interviews a week back
"08/10/2021, 10:25",Om,Any one facing difficulty in understanding the hypothesis testing... checkout below link... It cleared many of my doubts..
"08/10/2021, 11:23",Shankar,There is an extra video explaining hypothesis testing in Applied AI by Srikanth. It was the best explanation I ever watched.

"08/10/2021, 11:48",Atharva,Reduce epochs to 20 or even less
"08/10/2021, 11:49",Shradha,"Yeah, it works good at around 15"

"08/10/2021, 12:53",Tripti,can someone please suggest best material/website to quickly revise all the ML/DL concepts before an interview
"08/10/2021, 12:58",Priyanshi,I think own notes works the best. You write them in own language. You can create summarized notes.
"08/10/2021, 12:58",Priyanshi,Or highlight in original ones
"08/10/2021, 13:01",Tripti,don't have those with me at the moment.

"18/10/2021, 11:04",Om,ohk..will ignore it for now..and proceed
"18/10/2021, 11:05",Priyanshi,Brackets and sequence of multiplication is the reason. You can move ahead with this results.
"18/10/2021, 11:06",Om,ohk..I spent around 2 hours just to figure out where the derivative has gone wrong😁..thanks for the response
"18/10/2021, 11:11",Rohan,"Hmm, It is important to learn how not to debug wrong problems 😅"
"18/10/2021, 11:12",Om,😂 yah..  learned that today
"18/10/2021, 11:15",Bavya,Same I spend two hrs in np.median computation only to learn after 2 hrs that it was a datatype issue. The assignments are taking time whenever I get stuck. So I take a break and come back later that day or next day to resolve it. Ends up taking a lot of time per assignment 🤷🏽‍♂️
"18/10/2021, 11:54",Suryansh,you're right
"18/10/2021, 11:55",Suryansh,i once spent 2 days writing 60 lines of code the team replaced in 20 🤦🏽‍♂️
"18/10/2021, 14:25",Karan,"Hey guys,"
"18/10/2021, 14:26",Sherya,Use lightgbm. Will take you 1.5-2 hrs

"19/10/2021, 21:11",Ranjit,One time
"19/10/2021, 21:28",Murat,So If we pause the course for 2 months do we get an extension in the time line?

"20/10/2021, 17:41",Bavya,Oh since its random sampling any chance that the values may vary from person to person
"20/10/2021, 17:43",Priyanshi,No yours values will be close to them and despite it's random sampling you're using bootstrapping so that results should be reproducible to some extent.

As a result, there is no difference in your accuracy, plus the data is balanced so even if you predict the target variable randomly the accuracy will be 0.5.The reason, your loss doesn't reduce significantly with epochs is SGD optimizer which is slow at convergence."
"29/10/2021, 13:58",Sherya,Increase the epochs.
"29/10/2021, 14:02",Rohan,"Yes, with simple rule based model got around 67% accuracy 😅"
"29/10/2021, 14:04",Rohan,"But even in that case the log loss was around 11, so got confused, why MLP is giving good log loss but bad accuracy"

"10/11/2021, 18:02",Priya,You have warehouse order data for the last 3 years including millions of orders. Each order contains multiple items. These items are arranged throughout the large warehouse 300m * 300m spread around 2 floors. 100 Pickers pick set of orders as they are assigned every hour by the supervisors. How can you decrease picking effort using optimization & data science by rearranging warehousing or some picking algorithm?
"10/11/2021, 18:03",Priya,Anyone can give any suggestion?

"10/11/2021, 19:37",Abhinav,You have to try bro. Initially it was tough for me now I completed 26 assignments.

"11/11/2021, 19:39",Sanket,And technically *W* is same for each time step if we update one all will get update

"12/11/2021, 20:47",Karam,The function cubesum() is to return an int which is the sum of the cubes of individual digits of that number
"12/11/2021, 20:50",Karam,Eg. Cubesum(463) returns 307
"12/11/2021, 20:51",Pinky,"okay,"
"12/11/2021, 21:10",Karam,sum is a keyword in python. It is a bad programming habit to use keywords as variable names👌

"22/11/2021, 18:43",Aadesh,What is meant by saving a model?.
"22/11/2021, 18:47",Yogesh,mostly pickle file
"22/11/2021, 18:48",Yogesh,Productionization and deployment of Machine Learning Models
"22/11/2021, 18:48",Sherya,"Weights, metric score, loss logs, etc."
"22/11/2021, 18:48",Yogesh,in chapetr 5
"22/11/2021, 18:48",Yogesh,you create a pickle file
"22/11/2021, 18:49",Aadesh,Okay
"22/11/2021, 18:50",Aadesh,So this will be py file or pickle?
"22/11/2021, 18:50",Yogesh,no weights metrics log-loss
"22/11/2021, 18:50",Yogesh,only pickle file
"22/11/2021, 18:50",Aadesh,I think py
"22/11/2021, 18:51",Yogesh,and if you want to improve the latency
"22/11/2021, 18:51",Aadesh,What will go for deployment or production?
"22/11/2021, 18:51",Aadesh,"This if we are running on jupyter ,"
"22/11/2021, 18:52",Aadesh,As per my thoughts...
"22/11/2021, 18:52",Yogesh,then in the case of linear models (logistic or SVM) you deploy weights and if-else condition in tree based models (decision tree- random forest GBDT)
"22/11/2021, 18:52",Yogesh,no py file
"22/11/2021, 18:52",Yogesh,only pickle file
"22/11/2021, 18:52",Yogesh,only pickle file
"22/11/2021, 18:53",Yogesh,you create pickle file through sk-learn
"22/11/2021, 18:53",Yogesh,there is no relation to jupyter notebook
"22/11/2021, 18:54",Aadesh,"Okay... Can please share some reference article,"
"22/11/2021, 18:54",Yogesh,Productionization and deployment of Machine Learning Models
"22/11/2021, 18:54",Yogesh,in chapter 5
"22/11/2021, 18:54",Sherya,pickle file stores all declared variables in your py file in compressed format. For eg: if you create a picke for standard scaler object: it will store the values of mean and standard deviation of feature variable in training set. Then you can use this pickle file to standardize inputs in production by using: (x-mean)/std.
"22/11/2021, 18:55",Yogesh,no only pickle file
"22/11/2021, 18:55",Yogesh,you should have your basics right
"22/11/2021, 18:55",Yogesh,only pickle file
"22/11/2021, 19:09",Aadesh,Got it

"27/11/2021, 14:06",Sherya,"There is no generalized answer to this question. If the proportion of missing values is less compared to your data size, you can get rid of them. If this is not true, you need to try multiple imputation techniques and find what gives the best results."
"27/11/2021, 14:08",Yogesh,Replace it with class mean
"27/11/2021, 14:19",Rohit,https://medium.com/@sumitgulati59/insurance-risk-classification-380c805eca0e
"27/11/2021, 16:48",Shradha,This is nice 👍
"27/11/2021, 16:49",Shradha,"Actually, it's not numerical data the class is binary categorical of 0 and 1"
"27/11/2021, 16:50",Shradha,So 35 points out of 2000 is 1.75%. I can remove this much na
"27/11/2021, 16:53",Sherya,"1.75% is a large proportion. And your dataset is also small. Try with some imputation techniques: ffill,bfill,mode or use classification technique for imputation. Impute with mode first if it's a categorical variable then try others."
"27/11/2021, 16:57",Shradha,"Okay. Also, this variable is also the class variable that I need to predict so imputing 1.75% of class variable can affect the training? Also it is imbalanced with 1703:262 ratio s imputing with mode can be  a bad idea right?"
"27/11/2021, 17:04",Sherya,Yup mode won't be the right choice for this. Try with classification based imputation.
"27/11/2021, 17:05",Shradha,"Okay, I think imputing with KNN would be the way to go"
