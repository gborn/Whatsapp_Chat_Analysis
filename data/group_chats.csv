"10/05/2021, 17:13",Gita,While doing assignment.. I see lot of code in internet as in our assignment.. We will use that r we have to do completely new code???
"10/05/2021, 17:25",Nagaraju,If you use code from internet you need to cite its source
"10/05/2021, 17:26",Nav,"Even if you're copying the code, mention it's source and understand the logic. Blindly copying the code won't help at all"
"10/05/2021, 17:27",Nagaraju,If you copy code from someone's github then they will mark it as plagiarized
"10/05/2021, 17:28",Nagaraju,So be careful

"15/05/2021, 09:55",Silam,Hello any one know how to use logistic regression with optimization stochastic gradient descent
"15/05/2021, 09:58",Silam,Or SGDClassifier(loss='log') results in logistic regression
"15/05/2021, 09:58",Shyam,Make loss='log'
"15/05/2021, 09:58",Raghvendra,Yes
"15/05/2021, 09:59",Silam,Its mean after changing log loss its become logstic regession?
"15/05/2021, 09:59",Shyam,Yes
"15/05/2021, 09:59",Raghvendra,Correct

"15/05/2021, 17:28",Suyash,Can someone tell me what's wrong with the code ?
"15/05/2021, 18:18",Aadesh,Once Google the error. You might get close to the solution..
"15/05/2021, 18:19",Suyash,It is working with np.hstack but not scipy
"15/05/2021, 18:50",Aadesh,"In assignment 8E,"
"15/05/2021, 18:53",Sherya,xq should come from X_cv and xi should be your support vector
"15/05/2021, 18:53",Nitya,Apply np.reshape() first and then apply hstack
"15/05/2021, 18:54",Aadesh,Then alpha values=dual_coef_?
"15/05/2021, 18:54",Sherya,Yup
"15/05/2021, 18:54",Sherya,dual_coef_ = alphai * yi
"15/05/2021, 18:55",Aadesh,Okay.. let me try and work it out.. thanks!
"15/05/2021, 18:55",Aadesh,This will be computed  inside the decision function
"15/05/2021, 18:55",Aadesh,Along with kernel
"15/05/2021, 18:56",Sherya,"xq is your query point(should come from CV set), to compute output for xq you use sum(alphai*yi*k(xi,xq))"
"15/05/2021, 18:57",Sherya,alphai is zero for all non support vectors
"15/05/2021, 18:57",Sherya,I hope this helps

"16/05/2021, 19:39",Nagaraju,For assignment you need to continue with featurized data set
"16/05/2021, 19:40",Nagaraju,It's just 2 features you need to add
"16/05/2021, 19:40",Nagaraju,Check the notebook once

"17/05/2021, 15:08",Krishan,Hello Folks!
"17/05/2021, 15:13",Aadesh,How many values are 1 and how many are 0?
"17/05/2021, 15:17",Sherya,You have to find the output for all values of xq right? Then why are you indexing the first 10 values of Xcv?
"17/05/2021, 15:27",Raghvendra,My logic is failing somewhere so I am all as 1 's
"17/05/2021, 15:29",Raghvendra,for testing purpose I have taken only few points.
"17/05/2021, 15:32",Raghvendra,"Actually  I need to perform summation of alpha values and summation support vectors  for calculating the query point so I, missing  at that point."
"17/05/2021, 17:18",Dil,Anybody is working professional are there

"17/05/2021, 18:14",Nitya,Yupe assignments are lengthy
"17/05/2021, 18:14",Murat,Only 1 assignment so far
"17/05/2021, 18:15",Kirti,One of my experienced shared that....In beginning it takes time to solve..later we can solve easily
"17/05/2021, 18:16",Kirti,Just a little hope
"17/05/2021, 18:34",Namita,No bro deep learning takes lot of time
"17/05/2021, 18:35",Kirti,"Really, m not there.."

"17/05/2021, 18:44",Nagaraju,I wanted to complete them soon so I can get the first case studyüôà
"17/05/2021, 18:44",Nagaraju,Any one did them
"17/05/2021, 18:44",Nagaraju,?
"17/05/2021, 18:54",Nitya,Backpropagation n callbacks doesn't take much time to train
"17/05/2021, 18:55",Krishan,How is kaggle?
"17/05/2021, 18:57",Nagaraju,I have only tried colab
"17/05/2021, 18:58",Nitya,Does GCP free version work for 3 months only ?
"17/05/2021, 18:59",Naveen,I think it provides you free usage for 300 $ worth  after that you need to pay
"17/05/2021, 19:01",Nitya,I guess either 300$ or 3 months
"17/05/2021, 19:03",Naveen,Yeah yeah
"17/05/2021, 19:22",Simran,Is it easy to configure gcp?
"17/05/2021, 19:23",Krishan,Yes. GCP provides free access for 3months with $300 credits on your account.
"17/05/2021, 19:24",Nitya,"Don‚Äôt worry guyz , as we progress ahead and we have developed the habit , it will not take that much time"

"17/05/2021, 19:26",Nitya,The best practice that I do is to just check the top comment that most votes and then check some of its thread comments
"17/05/2021, 19:26",Murat,No there are 300 plus comments after each video. Just follow the first few maybe first 10 to 30 comments
"17/05/2021, 19:27",Kirti,Even though it  takes time. It's worthy
"17/05/2021, 19:27",Naveen,Just check if there is any edit for video from applied AI side . That's the only thing you need . If you feel you didn't understand something in video then go for comments and check if anyone has raised same question.
"17/05/2021, 19:27",Kirti,Some explain the topic more easier than in video
"17/05/2021, 19:27",Krishan,Where can we get GPUs?
"17/05/2021, 19:27",Krishan,In any online tool?
"17/05/2021, 19:28",Kirti,Hey guys I have the total course pdf.... Do u guys need?
"17/05/2021, 19:28",Naveen,It's available in website itself right

"17/05/2021, 19:50",Kirti,"Hey guys, no mention ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"17/05/2021, 19:52",Sherya,Ask for a schedule from AAIC and try to compete with the schedule and stay ahead of it. Complete the first 3 modules quickly atleast 1 month before schedule they are the easiest. Doing this will buy you extra time to solve lengthy assignments.
"17/05/2021, 19:53",Anushka,Thanks broüëçüèª
"17/05/2021, 19:54",Virat,I have also completed module 1 and module 2 in 2weeks...
"17/05/2021, 19:56",Sherya,Good job bro. Try to be consistent. I was in a similar situation like you but I lost consistency and I am currently lagging behind the schedule by 50 days.
"17/05/2021, 19:58",Virat,Hoping to not loss consistency...
"17/05/2021, 20:04",Dil,Mee too
"17/05/2021, 20:05",Simran,I suggest to read this small good book on developing habits -  *Atomic Habits by James Clear*
"17/05/2021, 20:10",Dil,What is step size=1 in SGD assignment?

"18/05/2021, 10:00",Siddhesh,@919652638618 hi...
"18/05/2021, 10:01",Priyanka,Name written on the pdf
"18/05/2021, 10:01",Siddhesh,Okay

"18/05/2021, 10:04",Priyanka,This pdf was also appreciated Srikant  sir in his lecture videos
"18/05/2021, 10:05",Siddhesh,Oh... really...
"18/05/2021, 10:05",Priyanka,I don't remember exactly
"18/05/2021, 10:05",Priyanka,But it was in module 1
"18/05/2021, 10:05",Siddhesh,Ok...
"18/05/2021, 10:05",Siddhesh,Grt.. thanks
"18/05/2021, 10:06",Priyanka,In starting lectures i guess
"18/05/2021, 10:52",Nagaraju,Just build a simple model using those features to predict ratings
"18/05/2021, 10:52",Nagaraju,And show the rmse
"18/05/2021, 10:58",Shruti,I am getting errors can share screenshot or code?
"18/05/2021, 10:59",Nagaraju,I'll send it in a while

"18/05/2021, 18:49",Dil,"In SGD problem,I am getting predicted probability as 1 for one of the example,because of this logloss is failung simce log(1-1) is zero.haa any one faced this issue?"
"18/05/2021, 18:50",Priti,log(0) is not zero. It is -inf
"18/05/2021, 18:50",Dil,I mean it is failing for log(0)
"18/05/2021, 18:51",Dil,Since it is not defined
"18/05/2021, 18:52",Dil,"I am planning to replace predictions 0 and 1 with some other values like close to 0 and 1,Is it the right approach?"
"18/05/2021, 18:52",Priti,sounds right
"18/05/2021, 18:53",Dil,No one faced thisissue in SGD?
"18/05/2021, 18:54",Pranjal,I am also facing
"18/05/2021, 18:54",Pranjal,The same issue
"18/05/2021, 18:54",Pranjal,Fir me values are turning to nan
"18/05/2021, 22:03",Namita,Do anyone have idea about how to read 8GB csv file efficiently in less time?
"18/05/2021, 22:04",Aadesh,Use wget command
"18/05/2021, 22:04",Aadesh,It'll take pretty much less time compared to other methods
"18/05/2021, 22:04",Nav,Don't upload the dataset on your jupyter notebook
"18/05/2021, 22:04",Nav,Use wget yeah
"18/05/2021, 22:05",Nav,Curlwget
"18/05/2021, 22:05",Nav,You can find the tutorial on youtube
"18/05/2021, 22:05",Namita,The file is in my local system not on cloud so v can't go for curlwget
"18/05/2021, 22:07",Murat,Doesn't Google colab allow that much data?
"18/05/2021, 22:08",Murat,It  has around 15gb I guess for each account
"18/05/2021, 22:08",Nav,Have you tried using Dask?
"18/05/2021, 22:09",Nav,Still it would take time to load 8 gb
"18/05/2021, 22:09",Krishan,You could try on GCP.
"18/05/2021, 22:10",Murat,What is the volume of the data? I mean no.of records?
"18/05/2021, 22:10",Namita,around 3million rows
"18/05/2021, 22:10",Murat,Maybe you can put it on some columnar database
"18/05/2021, 22:11",Murat,Teradata
"18/05/2021, 22:11",Murat,Or something like that
"18/05/2021, 22:12",Pranjal,Try using simple with open
"18/05/2021, 22:12",Priya,Don't use pandas it will consume your RAM....instead write a script to read line by line using CSV module
"18/05/2021, 22:12",Murat,If you can split the data and populate as seperate tables and then use it with joins as per your requirement. More like an ETL
"18/05/2021, 22:13",Murat,Will clean unnecessary if any to certain extent
"18/05/2021, 22:13",Murat,But it's time consuming
"18/05/2021, 22:13",Simran,"If the data is in Google drive, use !gdown command in colab"
"18/05/2021, 22:13",Simran,It's very fast
"18/05/2021, 22:14",Namita,yeah problem is its in local system i am searching for a option not use cloud
"18/05/2021, 22:14",Simran,Ok
"18/05/2021, 22:16",Murat,Usually in companies 3 million records are easily handled in databases but you need to have enough disk space also
"18/05/2021, 22:17",Murat,That's why suggested database
"18/05/2021, 22:19",Namita,Yup trying for to create data base thx for responsponding
"18/05/2021, 22:23",Murat,Use a columnar database that will be extremely fast
"18/05/2021, 22:24",Murat,Because it will populate data column wise and throws the query results in seconds
"18/05/2021, 23:02",Namita,Found solution dask library worked
"19/05/2021, 11:48",Ankit,Hey guys
"19/05/2021, 19:12",Ashish,Hi guys. Is anyone working on Assignment 9 - DT on Donors Dataset. Is the 3d plot visible after executing the code in the given file -  3d_scatter_plot.ipynb?
"19/05/2021, 19:13",Namita,Check for magic line
"19/05/2021, 19:16",Ashish,I have added the
"19/05/2021, 19:17",Pranjal,You have to add a function which contains jsn
"19/05/2021, 19:17",Pranjal,*js
"19/05/2021, 19:17",Pranjal,Just google you will found the function
"19/05/2021, 19:19",Ashish,Okay. Thank you :)
"19/05/2021, 19:20",Sandesh,Or you can just use the confusion matrix. It was either a 3d plot or confusion matrix if I remember correctly ?
"19/05/2021, 19:21",Ashish,"Yes, it was either. I wanted to try out the 3d plot."
"19/05/2021, 19:21",Ashish,Thank you
"19/05/2021, 19:47",Suyash,Did it work ?
"19/05/2021, 19:47",Suyash,Please mention the code you've written to work . It didn't work for me either
"19/05/2021, 20:19",Ashish,"I am trying it out. Not sure if its because I am using google colab. If I get it, I will let you know"
"19/05/2021, 20:22",Suyash,Sure
"19/05/2021, 20:40",Pranjal,Try it out ... When you're done and if didn't worked out.. msg me I will help you... But first try it out yourself
"19/05/2021, 20:41",Ashish,"Sure, I will try it out. If I still don't get it, I'll approach you for help/guidance."
"19/05/2021, 20:41",Pranjal,Okay
"19/05/2021, 20:59",Aadesh,I tried using 3d plot.
"19/05/2021, 21:01",Ashish,Ooh okay
"19/05/2021, 21:10",Nagaraju,Anyone who's done backprop assignment

"19/05/2021, 21:11",Nagaraju,My grader is not passing because of one number being different
"19/05/2021, 21:11",Nagaraju,What can i do?
"19/05/2021, 21:42",Dil,When u started applied ai
"19/05/2021, 22:36",Nitya,U can modify value of grader function beyond  6 decimal point
"19/05/2021, 22:36",Nagaraju,Team won't say anythin?
"19/05/2021, 22:37",Nitya,I asked them for the same..they told me the solution

"20/05/2021, 20:01",Ranjit,+1
"20/05/2021, 20:01",Namita,i had done
"20/05/2021, 20:02",Namita,but on a local system
"20/05/2021, 20:16",Krishan,You were able to do featurization for bigram on byte files on local?
"20/05/2021, 20:17",Namita,6 hours 16GB ram i7 processor 1TB hard disk
"20/05/2021, 20:18",Sandesh,I am trying the malware detection as well. When trying to convert from .bytes to .txt it gets stuck and it says permission denied. Is anyone fscing this issue ?
"20/05/2021, 20:18",Nagaraju,Woah
"20/05/2021, 20:19",Krishan,Niceüëç
"20/05/2021, 20:19",Nagaraju,But how tough is the assignment itself
"20/05/2021, 20:20",Namita,Computation is time consuming
"20/05/2021, 20:20",Krishan,"Yes. Actually, it is time consuming."
"20/05/2021, 20:21",Prajwal,My personal suggestion is to do malware assignment at the last..While doing that assignment I lost my consistency and get lost of frustration because of run time crashes..

"20/05/2021, 20:22",Krishan,üëç
"20/05/2021, 20:23",Nagaraju,I think i will take this advice
"20/05/2021, 20:23",Nagaraju,Lots of people on slack also have problems with this one assignment!
"20/05/2021, 20:23",Namita,Keep that assignment at last if you at middle of course u vl get demotivated
"20/05/2021, 20:24",Priyanka,239 gbüò≥
"20/05/2021, 20:24",Namita,üòÇüôè
"20/05/2021, 20:24",Namita,Imagine of training the model on this data
"20/05/2021, 20:24",Prajwal,And for mock interview and case study also they will give exception for this..we need 15 assignments only..I get completed the case study and mock and still Not completed Microsoft..But I will do after completing all assignments and remaining self Casestudy
"20/05/2021, 20:25",Sherya,If it takes 6hrs to run the code then how is it possible to complete this in Google colab?
"20/05/2021, 20:25",Prajwal,Yes teja..what you said is right..I remembered those days
"20/05/2021, 20:25",Namita,Colab doesn't work go for GCP if u have strong internet
"20/05/2021, 20:26",Namita,Or else prefer local system if it can meet requirments
"20/05/2021, 20:26",Sherya,I have 4 gb ram üòÖ
"20/05/2021, 20:26",Namita,Go for gcp if u have credit card
"20/05/2021, 20:27",Prajwal,Use GCP if possible for you or else 25 GB ram notebook provided in that assignment itself for doing computations and need to do but of engineering here like taking features in batch wise and storing parallely
"20/05/2021, 20:27",Sandesh,It would have been better if this data would have been hosted somewhere and we could just stream the data. With this I am stuck at one point with permission denied and am not able to proceed further
"20/05/2021, 20:33",Namita,My suggestion is Better try this assignment after doing deep learning bcoz in DL assignments r more tuff and time consuming after doing those assignments u vl feel this a bit easy
"20/05/2021, 20:39",Krishan,"For the Clustering Assignment, can anyone share what best n_clusters they were getting?"
"20/05/2021, 20:40",Nagaraju,Which DL assignments are easy.
"20/05/2021, 20:41",Namita,"Apart from NLP attention mechanism,  image segmentation remaing are easy these two are super tuff"
"20/05/2021, 20:45",Namita,But as course progress on u vl understand the level of tuffness
"20/05/2021, 21:09",Prajwal,Nice suggestion teja..I too thinking to say this only..
"20/05/2021, 21:09",Nagaraju,Thanks a lot!!
"20/05/2021, 21:15",Naveen,Hey
"20/05/2021, 21:15",Naveen,You can use your GPU if you have it right
"20/05/2021, 21:18",Namita,No idea I guess v can access gpu only for deep learning that too nvedia but not sure
"20/05/2021, 21:22",Naveen,Yeah I use it for  deep learning models. For ml based models also you can change your training mode by tweaking code.
"20/05/2021, 21:24",Naveen,You need CUDA for nvidia

"21/05/2021, 08:24",Aadesh,Ignore it
"21/05/2021, 08:24",Aadesh,I mean do univariate analysis.. if you feel it is important then include it.

"21/05/2021, 09:37",Sherya,Okay
"21/05/2021, 09:38",Sherya,I am going as per schedule but any ways I am lagging behind by atleast 50 days I üò≠
"21/05/2021, 09:40",Nagaraju,That schedule is messed up
"21/05/2021, 09:40",Nagaraju,I don't think anyone would be able to do that
"21/05/2021, 09:42",Param,üòÇüòÇ
"21/05/2021, 09:43",Murat,Agreed. It gave me so many videos to cover in a single day which is impossible

"21/05/2021, 10:26",Nagaraju,They should use some ai based schedulingüòÇ
"21/05/2021, 10:39",Murat,If you give one half hour of time per day because of work and the schedule that they send requires 3 to 4 hours atleast.
"21/05/2021, 10:41",Nagaraju,Some times you need to rewatch a section as well
"21/05/2021, 10:42",Murat,Yes. Some math needs to be revisited
"21/05/2021, 10:42",Anmol,Making individual notes is another task altogether

"21/05/2021, 10:45",Nagaraju,Content you can complete
"21/05/2021, 10:45",Nagaraju,Assignments and case studies
"21/05/2021, 10:46",Nagaraju,Needs a lot of dedicated hours
"21/05/2021, 10:51",Krishan,Do they extend the validity of the course?
"21/05/2021, 10:52",Himanshu,For 2 months
"21/05/2021, 10:53",Nagaraju,Only if you have a good reason
"21/05/2021, 10:54",Nagaraju,Otherwise you have to pay 17k
"21/05/2021, 10:54",Nagaraju,For a year extension

"21/05/2021, 10:59",Nagaraju,I complete assignments as I complete the content
"21/05/2021, 11:00",Nagaraju,Another person I know did content for 6 months and assignments for the next 6
"21/05/2021, 11:00",Nagaraju,So it's subjective
"21/05/2021, 11:02",Suyash,"I'm also following the same but as u mentioned the second strategy , which is more efficient?"

"21/05/2021, 11:04",Nagaraju,Using first approach
"21/05/2021, 11:18",Dil,6months 70% gud only
"21/05/2021, 11:19",Nagaraju,What I heard is
"21/05/2021, 11:20",Dil,Oo
"21/05/2021, 11:20",Dil,How many daily u r preparing r u working suraj
"21/05/2021, 11:20",Nagaraju,Self case study that is
"21/05/2021, 11:21",Nagaraju,I'm final year student
"21/05/2021, 11:21",Dil,Oo great ..best of luck..
"21/05/2021, 11:21",Nagaraju,I'm from non Cs
"21/05/2021, 11:22",Dil,I think u r preparing for 3hrs daily
"21/05/2021, 11:22",Nagaraju,Many things were new
"21/05/2021, 11:23",Nagaraju,2 hours yes
"21/05/2021, 11:25",Virat,I'm also from Non Cs background.. for me also coding part or solving assignment takes more time..
"21/05/2021, 11:26",Nagaraju,Yeah!
"21/05/2021, 11:40",Gagan,Any Tip for working professional?
"21/05/2021, 11:41",Gagan,I thought of completing it in 6 months.
"21/05/2021, 11:42",Sherya,Everything is same as SGD assignment just do the following things:
"21/05/2021, 11:43",Kirti,everyone thinks like that :)
"21/05/2021, 11:43",Dil,"I wake up @ 5:00 Am just to spend two hours dedicatedly.since this is WFH time,when ever work load is less I will watch tutorials..still my pace is not great though."
"21/05/2021, 11:44",Silam,So we can use SGD with skelaern? Right
"21/05/2021, 11:44",Sherya,How much have you completed content and assignment? and how much time is left?
"21/05/2021, 11:45",Dil,"I completed more than 100 days still in Module-3,completed till SGD assignment"
"21/05/2021, 11:46",Nagaraju,That's good
"21/05/2021, 11:46",Nagaraju,Module 3 is quite long
"21/05/2021, 11:59",Dil,No probs .. be positive may be u r learning deeply .. and also working professional
"21/05/2021, 12:00",Nav,Anyone here has worked with Unity3D?? I need some help
"21/05/2021, 12:03",Dil,Where were u know in course
"21/05/2021, 12:03",Dil,Am 60days but still in module 2
"21/05/2021, 12:04",Dil,Half part
"21/05/2021, 13:20",Aadesh,Have you checked the results along with loss function and without it?
"21/05/2021, 13:20",Sherya,Use the same loss funcn you used in SGD assignment
"21/05/2021, 13:21",Aadesh,Okay!!
"21/05/2021, 13:46",Gagan,I have joined the course 15 days back and now I have completed 50% of 1 module.
"21/05/2021, 14:22",Aadesh,What was the accuracy you obtained
"21/05/2021, 14:28",Virat,I have also started 15days back... I have completed upto module2 50%
"21/05/2021, 14:35",Suyash,Yes you're doing good . Just  don't stop putting efforts ..
"21/05/2021, 14:39",Gagan,Good going.
"21/05/2021, 14:44",Nagaraju,I watch the videos on 1.75x
"21/05/2021, 14:44",Nagaraju,That helps
"21/05/2021, 15:11",Virat,I am watching videos on normal mode only..
"21/05/2021, 15:13",Suyash,Try atleast 1.25x
"21/05/2021, 15:14",Suyash,It's not that fast but lets u save time also
"21/05/2021, 15:15",Virat,Ohk..üëçüëç
"21/05/2021, 15:20",Nagaraju,Yeah normal is quite slow
"21/05/2021, 15:21",Nagaraju,"Get a browser extension that allows you to set speed to any multiplier(like apart from the standard 1.25,1.5,1.75,2x)"
"21/05/2021, 15:32",Sherya,Logloss flattened at 0.085 when plotted against epochs
"21/05/2021, 15:33",Aadesh,Okay .. did you tune the hyperparameters
"21/05/2021, 15:34",Sherya,Noo.. you are talking assignment 8F right? It was not asked anywhere.
"21/05/2021, 15:35",Aadesh,Yaa.. it's optional
"21/05/2021, 15:35",Aadesh,If we want we can tune
"21/05/2021, 15:35",Aadesh,I don't see if they asked to plot us anything in 8F!!
"21/05/2021, 15:37",Sherya,Ohh then I didn't do it üòÖ
"21/05/2021, 15:37",Sherya,They will ask you to plot train loss against epochs
"21/05/2021, 15:38",Aadesh,Okay.. then I will do it!!
"21/05/2021, 15:50",Murat,Watch in 1.5x will save lot of time
"21/05/2021, 20:21",Priya,Can anyone tell me if there is any case study in AAIC which involves Object Detection or Image Segmentation techniques?

"21/05/2021, 22:57",Naveen,"I think it's better to ask each other queries in terms of completion of assignments and   any conceptual discussion. Because there are different people Joining at different instances so someone will be advanced and some one will be slow. But believe me everyone are good at their own pace and If you really want to complete this course you'll definitely allocate time no matter what and how hard it is , you'll still find time .So it's better to Focus on gaining technical knowledge from each other instead of tracking course where we sre standing compared to other just to stay motivated . for your own good .

"31/05/2021, 10:50",Krishan,I feel it's always much better to do assignment after the theory because it gives more practical knowledge to the theory we have learnt.
"31/05/2021, 10:51",Priyanka,Thanks for nice input!

"31/05/2021, 17:55",Dil,What needs to be donw assignment 8F
"31/05/2021, 17:55",Dil,I could not understand it
"31/05/2021, 17:56",Dil,Need to apply SGD by changing loss function train data or cv data?
"31/05/2021, 18:01",Ashish,You'll need to change the value of y in the log loss function. If y was taking the value 0 change it to y-  value and when y = 1 change it to y+ value. Everything else remains the same
"31/05/2021, 18:02",Ashish,N corresponds to number of points in train data
"31/05/2021, 18:03",Dil,"Ok,So on Train data set we need to find w and b by SGD and apply it on test data set?"
"31/05/2021, 18:04",Dil,Then what is related to cv on this line?

"31/05/2021, 18:04",Dil,Instruction no4
"31/05/2021, 18:05",Ashish,While calculating y+ and y- the formula has N in it. This N corresponds to number of data points in train data.
"31/05/2021, 18:09",Dil,"That I did, Could not understand what are they saying about CV data set"
"31/05/2021, 18:11",Ashish,8E is done on the training set and 8F is done on cv and test set. So I believe that is why they mentioned ycv

"17/06/2021, 16:59",Naveen,hey from my undetstanding and few friends that have been graduating / started working i can say.. it is really huge and you can easily get into AI domain if you start of with analytics based roles / ml roles .
"17/06/2021, 16:59",Dil,I am a working guy with 11 yrs..already been to US on H1..
"17/06/2021, 16:59",Naveen,so i think youre planning to shift to ML roles right?
"17/06/2021, 17:00",Dil,Yeah..Right now I am Big Data developer..little ML exp..Want to move permanently to ML..

"17/06/2021, 17:04",Dil,"So,Do not know how is demand outside..In some interviews when I mentioned Little ML work I did in my role,even though it is prosuctinized,They are asking for ML Ops..MLOps is kind of hot stuff now"
"17/06/2021, 17:04",Naveen,True that.. if you have MS you can crack most of the roles. phd ..then sure shot .. people without MS or little/no experience in ML might face huge problem in job finding.

"17/06/2021, 18:08",Naveen,Only if you're cent percent sure I would suggest you to take up course in statistics or else as everyone else are saying go for ms in data science / ms in CS ( with electives in ml/dl/ds )
"17/06/2021, 18:08",Jyoti,Covered entire ML and basic Deep learning and computer vision

"17/06/2021, 18:22",Naveen,Go Europe then . It's hundred percent possible. Especially Germany and Italy offer free masters
"17/06/2021, 18:24",Jyoti,If anyone planning for masters my suggestion is choose from US/UK/Canada /Germany
"17/06/2021, 18:43",Sanjana,Which is preferable doing an ms in datascience or artificial intelligence..?
"17/06/2021, 18:47",Jyoti,AI
"17/06/2021, 19:06",Nav,"Thanks for all the advices guys, really helpful!"
"17/06/2021, 19:17",Murat,MSc statistics will be definitely beneficial. I'm a post grad in statistics but I lack coding skills hence I took the course. Statistics is definitely a good career path
"17/06/2021, 19:18",Murat,Instead of doing Ms data science you can go for Msc statistics
"17/06/2021, 19:18",Murat,In foreign universities
"17/06/2021, 19:20",Krishna,IISC
"17/06/2021, 19:20",Ashok,For that we have to write gate exam right
"17/06/2021, 19:22",Murat,Gate is for Computer Science

"09/07/2021, 06:31",Shyam,"Hi, this happened to me when I put <sos> in target sentence. Check preprocessing of input to decoder and target sentence"
"09/07/2021, 17:22",Dil,Am first reading all the content .. ml after that DL ..then I want to start assignments
"09/07/2021, 17:23",Dil,Is it correct one
"09/07/2021, 17:28",Karam,"Everyone with the strategy that works for him/her. for me, Content and assignments goes hand in handüëå"
"09/07/2021, 18:01",Sherya,"Try using a mix of the 2 approaches i.e watch all videos related to ML then solve all ML assignments and then go for DL videos first, followed by DL assignments."
"09/07/2021, 18:03",Aadesh,Better to complete the module and do the assignments related to those modules...in my point of view this is the better Otherwise you have to recall again all the concepts and it'll consume more time
"09/07/2021, 18:04",Raju,This takes less time too
"09/07/2021, 18:13",Priyanka,Gone through that

"09/07/2021, 19:30",Dil,U completed both ml and DL all topics ..now where where u
"09/07/2021, 19:48",Namita,My suggestion is do parallely assignment + content times saves a lot quickly u can complete assignment
"09/07/2021, 19:49",Sukh,Videos on weekdays and assignments on weekends works well for me
"09/07/2021, 19:50",Namita,Yup being working employee I follow same trend
"09/07/2021, 19:52",Sukh,Yep same
"09/07/2021, 20:05",Priyanka,Software engineer?
"09/07/2021, 20:06",Namita,Data scientist

"10/07/2021, 13:29",Raju,Line*
"10/07/2021, 13:44",Raju,Is it similar to the draw_line function in 8A
"10/07/2021, 13:55",Aman,bro i am having problem in tf-idf vectorizer assignment
"10/07/2021, 13:56",Abhinav,Yes plot all the data point with scatter plot and then try to plot the line.
"10/07/2021, 13:56",Abhinav,?
"10/07/2021, 13:58",Aman,I have submitted it but it is in evaluation mode.
"10/07/2021, 13:58",Aman,With the instructions actually
"10/07/2021, 13:59",Aman,And functional they told me to make
"10/07/2021, 14:00",Aman,Which we recall all three values.
"10/07/2021, 14:02",Raju,So you are having problems with transform function ??
"10/07/2021, 14:02",Raju,Or fit function ?
"10/07/2021, 14:03",Aman,fit function.
"10/07/2021, 14:03",Aman,inside the fit function i have to call the idf value function.
"10/07/2021, 14:05",Raju,So idf values are not inline with that of sklearn ?
"10/07/2021, 14:06",Raju,Thanks Hafiz bhai
"10/07/2021, 14:31",Aman,inide fit function - we need to call idf function.

"10/07/2021, 19:41",Aman,somebody up for 2nd task please?
"10/07/2021, 19:59",Abhinav,Use n_jobs ¬∞=-1
"10/07/2021, 20:00",Abhinav,Have you used the dataset from drive?? Or from your local drive??
"10/07/2021, 20:02",Abhinav,Read np.argsort documentation you can do it with it.
"10/07/2021, 20:03",Raghvendra,By default it is n_job=-1  it will consider all th processors. For xgb we must not use it I think  single the o/p of one model is I/p to other model
"10/07/2021, 20:04",Raghvendra,Dataset from the drive and I am able to preprocess the data as well
"10/07/2021, 20:05",Abhinav,Yes you are correct but we parallelized each data point of one model
"10/07/2021, 20:06",Priyanshi,Show your hyperparams set and you can try lightgbm.
"10/07/2021, 20:07",Abhinav,How much time it takes for hypermater tuning??
"10/07/2021, 20:09",Raghvendra,I did not training the  hyper parameters yet.
"10/07/2021, 20:10",Raghvendra,I did not train the hyper parameters yet

"12/07/2021, 19:18",Kirti,Is this correct?
"12/07/2021, 19:19",Param,yes
"12/07/2021, 19:21",Kirti,but we used Euclidean distance for LSH..that's also for categorical variable.
"12/07/2021, 19:22",Param,well..yeah thats pointü§î
"12/07/2021, 19:22",Sherya,For binary vectors we use Hamming distance usually
"12/07/2021, 19:23",Sherya,Vector conversion of a categorical variable will be a binary vector
"12/07/2021, 19:26",Kirti,Yes I understood. But how euclidean and manhattan is not for knn?
"12/07/2021, 19:26",Kirti,I couldn't get that
"12/07/2021, 19:27",Sherya,Well these mcqs don't make sense a lot of times. All three are used to calculate distances between vectors. In this case Manhattan distance and Hamming distance would give the same result
"12/07/2021, 20:37",Kirti,Ya..Got it
"13/07/2021, 00:05",Jyoti,Guys how long it took for u to train cnn on cifr?

"13/07/2021, 01:32",Nagaraju,Model 1 i would say

"13/07/2021, 12:18",Priyanshi,Also do optional python assignments. It will give you clarity of syntaxes.
"13/07/2021, 12:18",Dil,Kk
"13/07/2021, 12:18",Sherya,Try to solve the questions on paper first before coding. The reason you are not able to solve the questions is you have not understood the problem 100%. Try to solve it on paper as if you were teaching a kid.
"13/07/2021, 12:18",Nagaraju,Yes yes
"13/07/2021, 12:19",Priyanshi,Yes.

"13/07/2021, 18:55",Abhinav,Grader function for back propagation is correct
"13/07/2021, 19:00",Priyanka,My all values are correct

"15/07/2021, 22:27",Abhinav,Will Training time affect the model performance?
"15/07/2021, 22:29",Namita,Generally when you are working in a companies u use cloud services as the training time increases u need to pay more so most of start ups use light weighted models and in case of deep learning models if you train alot they tend to overfit
"15/07/2021, 22:30",Krishna,But here he used small dataset when compared to companies

"16/07/2021, 08:53",Abhinav,5b is the first auc task?
"16/07/2021, 08:54",Abhinav,Then 0.5 auc is right auc

"19/07/2021, 08:44",Priyanshi,How to check if you have converged on a saddle point?
"19/07/2021, 08:54",Aadesh,I think we would not know that very straight.. We will have to try with different learning rate different optimizer.
"19/07/2021, 08:57",Raju,you can use contour plot to  figure that out if you have converged at saddle point
"19/07/2021, 08:58",Priyanshi,But how will you know during training phase?
"19/07/2021, 08:58",Priyanshi,Yeah that's what I thought
"19/07/2021, 09:01",Aadesh,This can be done.. but can you elaborate more on the thought process?
"19/07/2021, 09:04",Raju,If we have two intersecting lines (contour lines )and if we observe a square like structure with that two lines intersecting at squares diagonal we can say this might me a saddle point
"19/07/2021, 09:04",Raju,If that makes sense
"19/07/2021, 09:04",Abhinav,I think both the training and test error will be high. Eventhogh you have enough data point
"19/07/2021, 09:05",Raju,<Media omitted>
"19/07/2021, 09:07",Aadesh,Yes.. but we will have to be sure that thisis only because of saddle point and not any other factors.

"19/07/2021, 09:08",Raju,That's the way to go

"19/07/2021, 22:41",Ashish,Hi. Has anyone worked on a single class classification problem?
"19/07/2021, 22:51",Tushar,I think single class classification boils down to binary class itself
"19/07/2021, 22:53",Tushar,"Because if we have output as infected, other class will be not infected with probability (1-p)"

"20/07/2021, 06:32",Dil,They are asking write python functions fit and transform on your own.
"20/07/2021, 06:34",Dil,Not to use tf idf vectorizer.

"20/07/2021, 16:25",Krishna,Interview question: let's say 3 prime numbers and thier sum is 100 and which are not exceed 36. What are the possible combinations we have
"20/07/2021, 16:25",Krishna,It's not only number. Difference between those numbers
"20/07/2021, 16:28",Sherya,How is this possible?
"20/07/2021, 17:20",Nagaraju,Difference between those numbers do not exceed 36?
"20/07/2021, 17:50",Ganesh,"To solve any problem,"
"20/07/2021, 17:57",Kirti,here's an example
"20/07/2021, 17:59",Kirti,This kind of problems we solved during JEE prep. But now I couldn't able to doüòÇ
"20/07/2021, 18:05",Namita,Coding task
"20/07/2021, 18:05",Ganesh,"Addition of any two odd numbers is even, hence we need to keep '2' as a mandatory number in the combination of all 3 no.s"
"20/07/2021, 18:06",Kirti,Yes this is one possible ans.
"20/07/2021, 18:06",Ganesh,"Correct, because they want number of possible combinations.."
"20/07/2021, 18:07",Kirti,yes
"20/07/2021, 18:23",Priyanka,Only 1 possible : 2+37+61
"20/07/2021, 18:24",Dil,"2,19,79.. difference is more than 36... That is the only one"
"20/07/2021, 21:33",Sachin,Yes I think it a possible answers
"20/07/2021, 21:34",Sachin,"If you knows ans, please send"
"20/07/2021, 22:40",Priyanka,In callbacks assignment we have build 5 dense layer but how do I decide no of units in each layers?

"21/07/2021, 18:25",Aadesh,Guys I have a question:
"21/07/2021, 18:27",Aadesh,And why?
"21/07/2021, 18:30",Priyanshi,C in SVM?
"21/07/2021, 18:30",Ganesh,it would be better if you clearly say what is the hyper parameter instead of notation.
"21/07/2021, 18:30",Abhinav,If c=1 then more reg in logistics regression.
"21/07/2021, 18:32",Aadesh,C in liner/logistics/svm. To me this question was for linear reg
"21/07/2021, 18:33",Aadesh,What about SVM and linear reg
"21/07/2021, 18:33",Abhinav,C is high mean high regularisation
"21/07/2021, 18:34",Aadesh,Why?
"21/07/2021, 18:39",Sherya,"C in sklearn is inversely proportional to regularisation term lambda used in formulation of L.R/SVM. If lambda is large then, you are penalizing your large weights more. Since, C is inversely proportional to lambda, high C would mean low lambda hence less regularisation i.e more chance your model overfits."
"21/07/2021, 18:41",Sherya,"On the contrary, low C would mean high lambda hence more regularisation i.e your model underfits."
"21/07/2021, 18:42",Aadesh,Okay...
"21/07/2021, 18:44",Aadesh,I got it this way ..
"21/07/2021, 18:45",Aadesh,Please correct if I am wrong
"21/07/2021, 18:45",Sherya,C is not multiplied with the error term but the weights.

"21/07/2021, 18:46",Tushar,This message was deleted
"21/07/2021, 18:48",Aadesh,If you if you check svm: c is associated with the error term!
"21/07/2021, 18:51",Sherya,"Well for SVM, things change slightly. But the whole idea still remains the same. If you have large C, lambda will be low i.e less regularisation so you will make less error on training data but your model won't generalize well and will overfit."
"21/07/2021, 18:55",Aadesh,<Media omitted>
"21/07/2021, 18:55",Aadesh,<Media omitted>
"21/07/2021, 18:55",Aadesh,Conclusion: lower value of c will give more regularisation
"21/07/2021, 18:55",Sherya,Yup
"21/07/2021, 19:45",Nagaraju,In this case C that is used is actually 1/lambda
"21/07/2021, 19:51",Aadesh,Yes

"28/07/2021, 18:12",Nav,1) Check if you have saved the log files correctly and if you're passing the correct path of the log files to the tensorboard callbacks or not
"28/07/2021, 18:13",Priyanshi,Show tb code

"28/07/2021, 18:23",Nav,and mention the path where the logs are
"28/07/2021, 18:23",Nav,then it should work
"28/07/2021, 18:23",Nav,Add the os.chdir() before log_dir
"28/07/2021, 18:24",Sherya,I would throw an error right?
"28/07/2021, 18:24",Nav,You can do two things
"28/07/2021, 18:24",Nav,One is mention pass the path of the log files as your log_dir in your callback
"28/07/2021, 18:24",Nav,Or
"28/07/2021, 18:25",Nav,"Change your working directory to where the log files are being saved, then use the callback"

"29/07/2021, 12:00",Priya,I am trying to build a complex model for predicting stock prices in future by using pre-trained BERT which gives embeddings of the news articles that I feed it with and then I want to combine these features with the series of past prices to feed to an lstm model to get the final predictions.

"29/07/2021, 12:00",Priya,Please help to clarify my doubt!
"29/07/2021, 13:35",Ganesh,Most popular ways is to concatenate
"29/07/2021, 13:38",Ganesh,Let's suppose bert is giving 512 dim vector as an embedding.
"29/07/2021, 15:40",Priya,ok...so 513 for a single day only.....I want to forecast based on the past 30 days price......will that be like a multivariate time series problem?

"30/07/2021, 00:45",Nagaraju,For X>=35.13 you'll just have to find the area of this portion in the normal distribution
"30/07/2021, 00:45",Paridhi,Yeah.. Thank you
"30/07/2021, 00:45",Nagaraju,You will get a probability
"30/07/2021, 00:47",Paridhi,Yes actually this is a question asked by professor.. As per my understanding.. Probability of student will graduate with in 5 year will be greater in that area

"30/07/2021, 00:55",Nagaraju,Which is a very small value

"30/07/2021, 00:55",Nagaraju,I think so
"30/07/2021, 00:56",Paridhi,But if someone ask.. Like that region will belong to whom
"30/07/2021, 00:56",Paridhi,Class A Or class B then
"30/07/2021, 00:56",Paridhi,Class A will be correct... Right?

"31/07/2021, 01:37",Guru,"shape --> (2110586, 324701)"
"31/07/2021, 01:37",Sherya,"Divide features into groups. Fit the model on batches, and then select the tip features from each batch"
"31/07/2021, 01:38",Sherya,top*
"31/07/2021, 01:38",Guru,hey great idea
"31/07/2021, 01:38",Guru,wait i try
"31/07/2021, 01:39",Sherya,Do it randomly
"31/07/2021, 02:48",Guru,its working thanks sumeet
"31/07/2021, 07:03",Murat,"Hi Sumeet, could not understand, dividing features into groups and then selecting top features. Can you explain?"
"31/07/2021, 08:43",Nagaraju,You can do one thing
"31/07/2021, 08:43",Nagaraju,You can use Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)
"31/07/2021, 08:58",Rohit,Is selecting top features from each batch equivalent to selecting top from complete data ?
"31/07/2021, 08:59",Priyanshi,Are you using random forest?
"31/07/2021, 08:59",Rohit,Yes
"31/07/2021, 09:26",Priyanshi,I think no as features are split based on gain it calculates gain of feature i based on other features.
"31/07/2021, 09:39",Ganesh,What kind of data it is.?
"31/07/2021, 09:39",Ganesh,"If it's a sparse data, logistic regression won't take more time."
"31/07/2021, 09:40",Ganesh,Another idea could be to selcet words with high idf values.
"31/07/2021, 09:47",Janhavi,Hey folks..gm
"31/07/2021, 09:47",Janhavi,"I told that, we can consider different combinations of each team/squad as each row/datapoint & pick each player's performance,age,strike rate etc to be the features & pose this problem as a regression task by cumulatively averaging the feature scores/some performance score based on the previous test series (target feature : Cumulative score out of 10). But he told I was wrong in my approach & he expected some kind of weighted approach to this kind of scenario."
"31/07/2021, 09:48",Janhavi,"So, I dono what could be the answer for this, any ideas would benefit me alot ?"
"31/07/2021, 09:51",Nagaraju,Can we perform time series forecasting on runs/average runs
"31/07/2021, 09:51",Nagaraju,And select top batsman from it
"31/07/2021, 09:51",Nagaraju,Just a question
"31/07/2021, 09:53",Janhavi,"Actually,  he expected that the model would be something like a ""One to many"" sort of architecture where output should be the best indian squad"
"31/07/2021, 09:54",Nagaraju,One more thing we can do is
"31/07/2021, 09:54",Nagaraju,And give more weight to performance on those pitches?
"31/07/2021, 09:55",Nagaraju,We can also attach some weight to age of player
"31/07/2021, 09:55",Nagaraju,How many times he got injured in the last season
"31/07/2021, 09:55",Nagaraju,Etc
"31/07/2021, 09:55",Janhavi,"So, random forest could work well right, where when we column sample some of the features we can always include the features of the best players for each of the ""m"" models ??"
"31/07/2021, 09:55",Nagaraju,This is for the featurization
"31/07/2021, 09:56",Janhavi,Yes üëçüëç üíØ
"31/07/2021, 09:57",Nagaraju,Actually I want led to ask one thing to everyone in the group
"31/07/2021, 09:57",Nagaraju,It's quite interesting
"31/07/2021, 09:58",Nagaraju,The way I would do is
"31/07/2021, 09:58",Nagaraju,It's sort of na√Øve but
"31/07/2021, 09:59",Nagaraju,Can someone help me understand how to pose this as a classification problem
"31/07/2021, 09:59",Janhavi,"If its kinda classification problem,  then it should be a multilabel classification right"
"31/07/2021, 10:05",Janhavi,Yea this is what even I told..
"31/07/2021, 10:10",Silam,If this cricket sqaud will be soved as regression problem then what will be the target variable. What we will try minimise???
"31/07/2021, 10:15",Janhavi,"If 15 players are selected in a squad then, there will be batsman,bowlers &  wicket keepers right --> So, we can come up with some custom target variables like cumulative scores of each player based on the feedback given by their coaches or scrape some interesting stat from BCCI website or Cricbuzz.com something like thatüòå"
"31/07/2021, 10:59",Sherya,Yup
"31/07/2021, 10:59",Sherya,That is how we find the top features in a random forest model
"31/07/2021, 11:00",Sherya,"If a particular feature is important in all base learners, then it's important for the random forest model also"
"31/07/2021, 11:04",Sherya,Forward feature selection and backward feature selection also work on similar lines not exactly same. I might be wrong though. It's worth experimenting :)
"31/07/2021, 11:06",Rohit,"Okay, i'll try this"
"31/07/2021, 11:56",Silam,"Hey your question is not exactly but similar to to movie ""Moneyball"" where the general manger of the team hired a statistc graduate to form a baseball team of underrated players."
"31/07/2021, 11:57",Silam,Maybe there will be articles on internet how did they do it.

"02/08/2021, 14:26",Vinay,One suggestion on schedule generator
"02/08/2021, 14:31",Priyanshi,"Yes it's not very useful. In my experience on avg you need 2.5x time for taking notes, understanding the concept."
"02/08/2021, 14:33",Vinay,Yes very true and if you start reading comments it will bring more frustration‚Ä¶
"02/08/2021, 14:41",Hayat,True I have experience the same..sometimes if becomes frustrating when you are not aligned with the schedule.
"02/08/2021, 14:44",Hayat,But it also provides us with the beach mark to follow and stay consistent.

"05/08/2021, 11:24",Silam,Yes
"05/08/2021, 11:26",Silam,Tfidf vectorizer returns sparse matrix which requires sparse.hstack but w2v returns a dense matrix so it requires np.hstack.
"05/08/2021, 11:26",Suryansh,you're right
"05/08/2021, 11:26",Suryansh,it worked. we don't need to add .tocsr() at the end of np.hstack

"05/08/2021, 20:16",Priyanshi,If we are trying to predict 7th day price based on time series data we basically shift target variable by 7 rows upwards thus for current day target variable will be 7th day price.
"05/08/2021, 21:08",Rohit,you can try forward fill
"05/08/2021, 21:09",Priyanshi,Same values as last value?
"05/08/2021, 21:09",Rohit,yes
"05/08/2021, 21:11",Priyanshi,But it will be misleading for model as I also have to predict for 90th day
"05/08/2021, 21:16",Rohit,"sorry I didn't get 90th day, this will happen for any offset #of rows.Other techniques such as mean, median can also be used but since it is a time series dataforward /backward fill will be more appropriate as it values will most match using these"

"06/08/2021, 20:24",Priyanshi,So you're sending plain texts for padding?
"06/08/2021, 20:25",Sherya,Yup but passing dtype as object
"06/08/2021, 20:25",Priyanshi,You first need to convert text into numbers using tokenizer
"06/08/2021, 20:25",Priyanshi,And then pad the numeric data
"06/08/2021, 20:26",Sherya,Okay
"06/08/2021, 20:26",Sherya,I will try this then. Thankyou :)

"13/08/2021, 15:53",Aadesh,Here you are getting division zero error. So check  what is denominator. It's fp and tn. So print fp and tn values. And check what is happening
"13/08/2021, 15:54",Mahendra,i watched but from scratch and from sklearn i found different values of auc score
"13/08/2021, 15:54",Aadesh,Division zero meaning number is divided by zero.
"13/08/2021, 15:55",Mahendra,thats why i want code

"13/08/2021, 15:56",Mahendra,after this i get error
"13/08/2021, 15:57",Aadesh,Put your print statements here to print the denominator. Before the calculation
"13/08/2021, 16:10",Nav,"1) Probably your fp and tn both are 0. Print and check all the values of tp, fp, tn, fn if they are making sense or not."

"17/08/2021, 16:23",Namita,to have less effect of outliers on the f1 score
"17/08/2021, 16:23",Krishna,They need mathematics
"17/08/2021, 16:25",Namita,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26355942/why-is-the-f-measure-a-harmonic-mean-and-not-an-arithmetic-mean-of-the-precision
"17/08/2021, 16:25",Priti,We use the harmonic mean instead of a simple average because it punishes extreme values. A classifier with a precision of 1.0 and a recall of 0.0 has a simple average of 0.5 but an F1 score of 0. The F1 score gives equal weight to both measures and is a specific example of the general FŒ≤ metric where Œ≤ can be adjusted to give more weight to either recall or precision.

"17/08/2021, 18:39",Nav,Yes
"17/08/2021, 18:39",Nav,when you're doing 'filepath' you're passing a string called filepath
"17/08/2021, 18:40",Nav,as in you're passing the name filepath itself as a string not any variable filepath that you've defined
"17/08/2021, 18:40",Nav,you need to pass pd.read_csv(filepath) to pass filepath as a variable that you've defined above

"20/08/2021, 16:36",Nav,"Yeah this is in case you need to be funded by a professor, mostly in countries like Canada where the professor himself has a lot of say in your admission. He/she needs proof of your ability to perform research or else it's his/her loss at funding you. In case of the taught programs too obviously having papers published gives a better edge at admission. But yeah I think NPTEL, edx (ones by MITx) ones are better than Coursera considering the rigour. As for CGPA, it can be overlooked if you have a good SOP, LoRs. Try for a 320+ in GRE as well"
"20/08/2021, 16:38",Nav,"Just that thesis based master's become difficult to get admitted into if you don't have a good cgpa, but it doesn't seem like you are interested in a thesis based master's."
"20/08/2021, 16:42",Sukh,Yeah to be honest I'm more inclined towards working in the industry
"20/08/2021, 16:45",Nav,Then I think you should do internships and end-to-end projects
"20/08/2021, 17:00",Karan,+ Try to get into analytics based firms for internship or full time jobs

"27/08/2021, 13:08",Priyanshi,Do it in batches and merge the output. Will take 2 hours in colab
"27/08/2021, 13:10",Silam,"If you got correct results, try to save it in pickle file. So you don't need to do it again"
"27/08/2021, 16:13",Raghvendra,Good suggestion. Thank you   Devendra.
"27/08/2021, 17:37",Priyanka,"What I did was ,took 2000 byte files at a tym , then made a bigram sparse matrix for it"
"27/08/2021, 17:37",Priyanka,Now I saved this sparse matrix as .npz format in my drive
"27/08/2021, 17:38",Priyanka,"For nxt 2000 bytefiles , should I create  different  .npz ?"
"27/08/2021, 17:39",Priyanka,Or i can add add nxt sparse matrix to this .npz which i created earlier?
"27/08/2021, 17:40",Priyanshi,Save separately
"27/08/2021, 19:42",Raghvendra,How much time did it took for you to process 2000  byte files .
"27/08/2021, 19:44",Priyanka,1 hr 10 min
"27/08/2021, 19:44",Priyanka,On an avg
"27/08/2021, 19:44",Priyanka,For each
"27/08/2021, 19:45",Priyanka,2000 byte file
"27/08/2021, 19:46",Raghvendra,Are  you using colab ?
"27/08/2021, 19:46",Priyanka,Yup
"27/08/2021, 19:46",Priyanka,Colab only
"27/08/2021, 19:50",Raghvendra,Thank you. I am using local environment it taking so much time more .have you uploaded the entire train data and then unzip  in colab?
"27/08/2021, 19:52",Priyanka,"I unzip the train data on my laptop only, then separated bytefiles from asm files using jupyter notebook"
"27/08/2021, 19:53",Priyanka,then uploaded bytefile and asm file folder on my google drive
"27/08/2021, 19:53",Priyanka,after that i started doing on colab
"27/08/2021, 19:57",Raghvendra,So 200 gb you  uploaded to Google Drive. How much time it took. Actually I am working on this assignment from last 10 days but    due issues I am  processing multiple times.
"27/08/2021, 19:58",Priyanka,bro I had space on my google drive thats why uploaded all the data
"27/08/2021, 19:58",Priyanka,but what u can do is upload only those 2000 bytefiles
"27/08/2021, 19:58",Priyanka,for which u r going create features
"27/08/2021, 19:59",Priyanka,"once done,then u could store those features in drive"
"27/08/2021, 19:59",Priyanka,then delete those bytefiles once they are used
"27/08/2021, 19:59",Priyanka,then again repeate the process
"27/08/2021, 20:01",Raghvendra,Thank you bro for the suggestion.

"28/08/2021, 14:09",Varun,after how many assignment completion AAIC provide mentor??
"28/08/2021, 14:24",Priyanshi,For case study they provide mentor
"28/08/2021, 14:24",Krishna,Why do u need mentor instead of google search
"28/08/2021, 14:25",Krishna,What mentor will do. Is he better than google search?
"28/08/2021, 14:25",Krishna,Does he knows better than frameworks docs

"29/08/2021, 15:49",Priya,Ground truth is in your user-item matrix...
"29/08/2021, 15:50",Priya,You can do kfold testing
"29/08/2021, 15:51",Priya,It basically picks submatrices and test other matrices.

"01/09/2021, 12:31",Suryansh,i think i need a list as an output but the grader function doesn‚Äôt seem to suggest that so i‚Äôm confused
"01/09/2021, 12:36",Mony,Output should be a fp number. I guess problem is in loop if it is running for long.
"01/09/2021, 12:36",Suryansh,fp number?
"01/09/2021, 12:36",Mony,Float value
"01/09/2021, 12:36",Priyanshi,you're saying for value in:
"01/09/2021, 12:36",Priyanshi,variable*
"01/09/2021, 12:37",Priyanshi,and what's data
"01/09/2021, 12:38",Suryansh,not referring that. just want to iterate those many times
"01/09/2021, 12:39",Suryansh,the csv file provided
"01/09/2021, 12:39",Priyanshi,no you have to calculate it only for user_id provided in input function
"01/09/2021, 12:39",Priyanshi,For example first part should be like 2*alpha*b_i[user_id]
"01/09/2021, 12:39",Suryansh,ohh but what about the summation
"01/09/2021, 12:40",Priyanshi,ignore summmation
"01/09/2021, 12:41",Suryansh,ohhhhh right right i‚Äôm trying it out
"01/09/2021, 12:42",Priyanshi,Here basically you're trying to learn user and movie specific biases.
"01/09/2021, 12:42",Priyanshi,with using SGD
"01/09/2021, 12:42",Suryansh,yes
"01/09/2021, 12:43",Suryansh,same for the second term right

"02/09/2021, 13:42",Mony,"Earlier they marked it plagiarised, after I explained them, they changed it to done plagiarised as I have used code mentioned in their notebook only."

"02/09/2021, 13:43",Mony,"I mailed them, yet to receive their response"
"02/09/2021, 13:47",Suryansh,yes ask them to get it back to done
"02/09/2021, 13:48",Suryansh,i think they said they‚Äôll nullify the assignment if it‚Äôs plagiarised so you should get it done quick
"02/09/2021, 13:49",Mony,"Yes, waiting for their response and in the assignment section, they mentioned ""assignment is accepted""."
"02/09/2021, 13:51",Anmol,It means you have used code
"02/09/2021, 13:51",Anmol,Copied from somebody or website
"02/09/2021, 13:51",Anmol,You should use comments to explain code if used from sources

"04/09/2021, 17:48",Priyanka,I too have same question
"04/09/2021, 17:49",Sherya,Yes. I think you have to pay 17-18k to extend
"04/09/2021, 17:49",Ritik,I think but you will have to pay
"04/09/2021, 17:50",Krishna,May be 60% f original fee

"04/09/2021, 18:24",Sherya,Problem is getting interview calls üòÇ
"04/09/2021, 18:26",Namita,Exactly
"04/09/2021, 18:36",Paridhi,That's actually motivation.. When you get placement notification mail and then you check the eligibility.... It works as a energy boosterüòÇ
"04/09/2021, 18:54",Naveen,The course content will work only if u get calls for interview..otherwise people are also getting calls after completing Udemy courses too
"04/09/2021, 18:55",Ritik,But still if you are eligible for cash back program isn't worth it?
"04/09/2021, 18:59",Sukh,Which Udemy course is that broüòÇ
"04/09/2021, 19:00",Naveen,Yea that's what I am talking qbout
"04/09/2021, 19:00",Naveen,Getting calls is the hard part
"04/09/2021, 19:02",Namita,Problem is most of the companies are looking for relavent  experience but without job how gonna v get experience üòÜ
"04/09/2021, 19:04",Prajwal,Completely agree and thing is that the number of job postings through appliedAI is very less but there are so many students who are enrolling into applied AI course..
"04/09/2021, 19:05",Naveen,There are terms and conditions for cashback program....there are 30 assignments...these are not simply import xgboost then fit it..
"04/09/2021, 19:06",Namita,That's the catch at end of day applied AI is business if you get placed u r lucky else u vl get money back and job gaurentee is just to attract audience
"04/09/2021, 19:07",Naveen,May be internship can help regarding this...
"04/09/2021, 19:08",Parul,Also one thing i noticed is the companies which come are usually from south side

"05/09/2021, 15:50",Abhinav,I think both are same
"05/09/2021, 15:50",Abhinav,How did you conclude that?
"05/09/2021, 15:51",Raju,SGD classifier is a algo to minimize loss
"05/09/2021, 15:51",Yogesh,Yes
"05/09/2021, 15:51",Raju,Depending on loss function used it's either logistic regression or svm or etc depending on loss function
"05/09/2021, 15:52",Raju,These implementation should be same internally
"05/09/2021, 15:53",Raju,But using SGD classifier and passing the loss function gives the flexibility to change from one algo to other quickly
"05/09/2021, 15:53",Raju,With change of loss fnct
"05/09/2021, 15:53",Raju,I too think they both should have similar implementation internally
"05/09/2021, 15:55",Abhinav,Yes only difference is regularisation term is inversely proportional. Otherwise all are same

"08/09/2021, 07:07",Priyanka,anyone?
"08/09/2021, 07:13",Yogesh,use L1 regularization
"08/09/2021, 07:13",Yogesh,hence non important features weight becomes 0
"08/09/2021, 07:13",Yogesh,Then for only important features weight will be computed
"08/09/2021, 07:14",Yogesh,see if you have 1000 features hence 1000 weights
"08/09/2021, 07:14",Yogesh,but if only 100 featueres are important
"08/09/2021, 07:14",Yogesh,then remaining 900 features weight will become 0
"08/09/2021, 07:14",Yogesh,hence while real time
"08/09/2021, 07:15",Yogesh,only those 100 weights will be used

"08/09/2021, 15:29",Priyanka,Can we solve dimensionality reduction with SGD?

"08/09/2021, 15:33",Namita,"Yes,We can"
"08/09/2021, 15:36",Nav,"I don't get it, SGD is an optimization algorithm. How's it solving dimensionality reduction?"
"08/09/2021, 15:37",Priyanka,is there a blog or something where I can read it in detail?
"08/09/2021, 18:16",Sherya,"Dimensionality Reduction is an application of Matrix Factorization. To factorize a matrix, we use SGD with a defined loss function."
"08/09/2021, 18:30",Nav,Thats indirectly using SGd
"08/09/2021, 18:30",Nav,Can be used anywhere we need to optimize right
"08/09/2021, 18:33",Sherya,Yup we can use SGD to optimize any function that is differentiable
"08/09/2021, 18:34",Sherya,"For Matrix Factorization, we do have to minimize a loss function i.e (Aij-(Bi.T * Cj))**2 should be minimum"
"08/09/2021, 19:55",Paridhi,<Media omitted>
"08/09/2021, 20:11",Nav,"No no i am saying that sgd or adagrad or adam or whatever you use for minimizing the loss. But the dimensionality reduction is not being done by the optimizer, right? Its being done by matrix factorization"
"08/09/2021, 20:11",Sherya,How would you factorize a matrix?
"08/09/2021, 20:13",Paridhi,I am getting the fig only in horizantal not on vertical though i have mentioned both x and y points
"08/09/2021, 20:17",Nav,Factorize the original matrix into a product of two matrices(which are basically the lower dimensional representations) using singular value decomposition. Then reduce the loss between original matrix and the product of the two matrices using any optimizer. Am I right?

"09/09/2021, 11:45",Raju,"Depends on features so , probably aiic wanted those features to be in a certain range"

"09/09/2021, 11:46",Rohan,"Yes [-1,1] or [0,1]"
"09/09/2021, 11:47",Nav,Scaling of numerical features totally depends on your problem statement. It's like you can't be sure that normalization performs a better job than standardization. It's kind of a trial and error thing
"09/09/2021, 11:47",Raju,Agree

"09/09/2021, 23:34",Silam,When you run your SGD let for your 1st epoch you will an updated w and b. Now you have to calculate logloss for this w and b to check they reduce the logloss or not. Now to calculate logloss you need y_actual and y_pred. But you don't have y_pred values.

"16/09/2021, 02:17",Abhinav,Equation is wrong
"16/09/2021, 02:17",Abhinav,"It should be (w.T,x)+b"
"16/09/2021, 02:18",Paridhi,Yes w.T
"16/09/2021, 02:23",Shradha,I changed it but nothing changed for some reason
"16/09/2021, 02:25",Shradha,"and as much i understand, dot product of w and x is equal to multiplication of w.T and x so equation should be right"
"16/09/2021, 02:27",Paridhi,W and w.t are diff print shape you might see the diff
"16/09/2021, 02:30",Shradha,yes but it's giving same output. idk how. How can I find out

"17/09/2021, 19:55",Rohan,Yeah thought so üòÖ but then they haven't explicitly mentioned
"17/09/2021, 20:58",Rohan,"Thanks...Getting accuracy equal to 1 in both model even after test train split what do I compare about it then, best parameter is also same =1"
"17/09/2021, 21:01",Priyanshi,Yes data is very less. You have to observe perturbation here not accuracy.
"17/09/2021, 21:02",Rohan,Okay yeah there is slight difference in weight vector only
"17/09/2021, 21:04",Priyanka,Anyone?

"17/09/2021, 21:31",Sherya,Use Xgboost or lightgbm
"17/09/2021, 21:32",Sherya,It will take a lot of time anyway
"17/09/2021, 21:34",Paridhi,I have spent 3 to 4 days just on it...so then did only 2 for each set no hyperparameter was used it is marked as evaluated
"17/09/2021, 21:35",Paridhi,So now it's better to know from exp people which might be the best option
"17/09/2021, 21:37",Paridhi,And is there any way i can run only the cells i want to correct instead of running all the cells right from the start?
"17/09/2021, 22:44",Rohan,"Will have to report cv accuracy in that case, not much issue for the objective of assignment to understand perturbation"

"18/09/2021, 16:48",Abhinav,Epcoh increase loss decrease it is good
"18/09/2021, 16:49",Abhinav,It should differs by atleast 10 power -2
"18/09/2021, 16:49",Rohan,Difference should be in 10^-3
"18/09/2021, 16:50",Shradha,"Actually, loss only decreased for epoch 0-2 and then it increases and stays almost constant in my case"
"18/09/2021, 16:50",Shradha,Yes I'm not able to figure out what am I doing wrong
"18/09/2021, 16:51",Abhinav,Show update rule code
"18/09/2021, 16:51",Rohan,Have u used tol =10^-4
"18/09/2021, 16:51",Shradha,<Media omitted>
"18/09/2021, 16:52",Shradha,"no, actually it was not mentioned in assignment. can you throw some light on what is that and how to use it"
"18/09/2021, 16:52",Abhinav,X_train is dataframe?
"18/09/2021, 16:53",Abhinav,If it is dataframe use x_train.iloc[i]
"18/09/2021, 16:53",Abhinav,Also check your dw function
"18/09/2021, 16:54",Shradha,No it's numpy array
"18/09/2021, 16:54",Rohan,"Tol is difference in the successive test loss , code execution will stop when successive test loss is less tha 10^-4 ...Indicating that our solution has converged"
"18/09/2021, 16:55",Shradha,"The grader function returned true for it, so that should be correct?"
"18/09/2021, 16:55",Seeta,What I see b = b + db and use should use tolerance
"18/09/2021, 16:56",Shradha,"Oh yes, that's a mistake. Thanks for pointing"
"18/09/2021, 16:56",Rohan,Yes
"18/09/2021, 16:57",Abhinav,Some we have to check
"18/09/2021, 17:01",Shradha,Oh thanks. I used dot instead of multiply and now I'm getting right results. Thank you very much üôåüèª ‚ú®
"18/09/2021, 17:05",Shradha,<Media omitted>
"18/09/2021, 17:06",Shradha,adding tolerance would help now?
"18/09/2021, 17:08",Rohan,I had this problem while doing  when tol=10^-5 it was not converging but converged when tol = 10^-4 .
"18/09/2021, 17:09",Rohan,Yes
"18/09/2021, 17:12",Shradha,if len(train_losses)>2:
"18/09/2021, 17:13",Shradha,"I wrote this for tolerance, but not observing difference for 3, 4 and 5 decimal places"
"18/09/2021, 17:15",Shradha,"it compares if upto 4 digit decimal of current train loss and previous train loss are same, then return w, b"
"18/09/2021, 17:22",Rohan,How much is eta0
"18/09/2021, 17:23",Shradha,eta0 is 0.0001
"18/09/2021, 17:23",Shradha,This must be wrong in some way right
"18/09/2021, 17:24",Rohan,Nope don't think so
"18/09/2021, 17:24",Rohan,Try and tweak eta and observe if any changes
"18/09/2021, 17:25",Shradha,"but the sklearn implementation has same eta0, alpha and tol"
"18/09/2021, 17:25",Shradha,changing it would not be allowed i guess
"18/09/2021, 17:26",Rohan,Yes just for testing
"18/09/2021, 17:26",Shradha,oh okay
"18/09/2021, 17:30",Rohan,w and b need to update outside the for loop
"18/09/2021, 17:32",Shradha,"but that for loop is only there to update w and b, if i remove it out, w and b will be updated for only last datapoint"
"18/09/2021, 17:33",Shradha,which can be done without iterating in range(lene(X_train))
"18/09/2021, 17:34",Rohan,Inside the loop dw = dw + gradient for that point
"18/09/2021, 17:36",Shradha,<Media omitted>
"18/09/2021, 17:38",Shradha,i'll try this

"18/09/2021, 17:41",Shradha,<Media omitted>
"18/09/2021, 17:42",Shradha,(t) is there right. it's the index no
"18/09/2021, 17:43",Shradha,I think there would be summation in the last equation if it had to be cumulative of all dws
"18/09/2021, 17:43",Rohan,"in video also they mentioned they are averaging the gradient vector for N data points, while deriving  and then updating"
"18/09/2021, 17:44",Rohan,see their is lambda / N term in grad_w formula

"18/09/2021, 17:58",Shradha,@917083496620 is this code correct?

"18/09/2021, 18:22",Raghvendra,<Media omitted>
"18/09/2021, 18:26",Abhinav,Is these weight are closer to input?

"23/09/2021, 14:15",Varun,Why not use forward feature selection while computing feature importance in knn....?
"23/09/2021, 14:24",Raju,we can do that considering its just an assignment but as its computationally expensive it should be the last option or sometimes it might not even be feasible in real-life scenario
"23/09/2021, 17:49",Rohan,<Media omitted>
"23/09/2021, 17:56",Varun,It could be expensive to compute in real life scenario..got your point...thanks
"23/09/2021, 18:04",Namita,Generally in companies data will be huge and most of them use cloud resources as the computation time increases cost also increases
"23/09/2021, 19:07",Shradha,"I think Instead of fit_params, it should be param_grid"

"24/09/2021, 09:43",Paridhi,And why do i need to download files can't i directly use files from drive using link?
"24/09/2021, 09:45",Guru,in BERT assignment what we have to pass in tokenizer.FullTokenizer as vocab_file
"24/09/2021, 09:45",Guru,use Jupiter their
"24/09/2021, 09:49",Guru,"if u are using cloud computing it will not consume your data to download any file as it is not going to download to your system , for Microsoft assignment it will take around 2-3 min only to download all the files"

"25/09/2021, 19:48",Priyanshi,Colab gives you a virtual instance. Local path won't work there. You can upload files to google drive and use that path after mounting the drive.

"25/09/2021, 21:40",Rohan,"In my opinion you should go with model-1. Because, False negative are critical in fraud detection. Since, you should not miss a fraud."
"25/09/2021, 21:42",Priyanka,"Ideally it should be the one which produces less false negative, at the same time your false positive is way way greater than in scenario two. Try to bring out false positive numbers almost similar, then choosing the one which gives less false negative is easier."
"25/09/2021, 21:42",Namita,Can stack two classifiers and go for majority vote??  Is that possible??
"25/09/2021, 21:47",Sherya,The one with high precision is a stacked model
"25/09/2021, 21:47",Sherya,This is the best model I could train
"25/09/2021, 21:52",Sherya,"But more false positives can bring dis reputation to a company right? The problem is to detect fraudulent insurance claims. If a company rejects genuine claims more often, people won't buy their policy. Right?"

"30/09/2021, 12:56",Namita,No idea bro it was asked in an interview
"30/09/2021, 12:57",Rohit,"for first, (1-0.85^6), since 5 min intervals are independent"
"30/09/2021, 12:58",Namita,Why  1-0.85??
"30/09/2021, 12:59",Rohit,proba of atleast one plane = 1- probab of seeing no planes
"30/09/2021, 12:59",Sanket,Because we are doing the case for no plane

"02/10/2021, 14:26",Ninad,how do we make such functions like StandardScaler() which which has different methods like fit and fit_transform. Do we need classes here ?
"02/10/2021, 14:44",Bavya,Hi quick question on decision trees assignment 9. Do we need to do one hot encoding for categorical features? Since only 5000 rows dataset and decision tree can work with categories do we need to do one hot encoding for them?
"02/10/2021, 14:52",Ninad,Not required in Decision Tree or related algorithms
"02/10/2021, 14:55",Bavya,"I thought the same , in the assignment instruction video though the lady mention perform encodin on categorical features and I am doubtful now"
"02/10/2021, 14:57",Ninad,"yeah, good point."
"02/10/2021, 14:57",Shradha,"Yes, StandardScalar() is a class which has functions like fit, transform, fit_transform (and obviously __init__ to intialize objects with some variables)"
"02/10/2021, 15:02",Ninad,I have a hard time understand _classes_ in the past. Any good resource to understand ?
"02/10/2021, 15:15",Bavya,Still the solution is good without the one hot encoding?
"02/10/2021, 15:48",Namita,Thx for the answer similar kind of question was asked in an interview

"02/10/2021, 18:41",Janhavi,Can someone tell me what could be the apt Performamce metric that can be used for image captioning task?
"02/10/2021, 19:43",Sherya,"Depends on what you will use image captioning for. Based on the core business problem, you need to decide what you need to decrease FN, FP or both."
"02/10/2021, 19:44",Sherya,This will hep you choose the apt business metric.
"02/10/2021, 19:51",Manisha,"Based on loss function, we adjust our weights..."
"02/10/2021, 19:54",Akshath,Yeah right
"02/10/2021, 20:05",Manisha,"First, we initialize weight randomly.. And based on that we calculate loss function. Once we calculate loss then we need to minimize loss by adjusting its weight."

"05/10/2021, 11:36",Pragya,Hi
"05/10/2021, 11:43",Rahul,what's  the issue
"05/10/2021, 11:48",Bavya,"For getting feature importance in decision trees, why is it advised in the assignment to set Max depth to none.. I guess we will get fully developed tress with single leaflets, that actually causes over fitting in decion tree algorithm though"
"05/10/2021, 15:32",Priyanka,"DenseNets-dense connectivity pattern is that it requires fewer parameters than traditional convolutional networks, as there is no need to relearn redundant feature-maps."
"05/10/2021, 15:32",Priyanka,Can anyone explain this?
"05/10/2021, 20:44",Abhinav,Using concatenation we are using feature map from all the previous layers.
"05/10/2021, 20:45",Abhinav,This is the reason for low parameters

"26/10/2021, 16:07",Namita,Use dask or modin pandas
"26/10/2021, 16:54",Nagaraju,You can try reading in chunks
"26/10/2021, 16:55",Sanket,Any has worked on unit test cases here ?
"26/10/2021, 17:18",Suryansh,you can use the inbuilt csv function which is much faster than pandas. but if you‚Äôre saying multiple sheets then just go with dask
"26/10/2021, 17:48",Monika,"Reading multiple and heavy files with pandas can lead to memory error, spark is the best way to read and using transformation and action according"

"27/10/2021, 15:11",Monika,Are you sure ?
"27/10/2021, 15:14",Shradha,Maybe create a function to convert json file into csv file first. It's possible with csv module

"29/10/2021, 13:56",Sherya,"If you observe, your loss is not reducing dramatically with epochs. As a result, there is no difference in your accuracy, plus the data is balanced so even if you predict the target variable randomly the accuracy will be 0.5.The reason, your loss doesn't reduce significantly with epochs is SGD optimizer which is slow at convergence."
"29/10/2021, 13:58",Sherya,Increase the epochs.

"09/11/2021, 14:11",Yogesh,First and second right
"09/11/2021, 14:13",Kirti,third statement is also correct because HAVING is applied on groups and WHERE is applied on individual rows

"10/11/2021, 18:02",Priya,You have warehouse order data for the last 3 years including millions of orders. Each order contains multiple items. These items are arranged throughout the large warehouse 300m * 300m spread around 2 floors. 100 Pickers pick set of orders as they are assigned every hour by the supervisors. How can you decrease picking effort using optimization & data science by rearranging warehousing or some picking algorithm?
"10/11/2021, 18:03",Priya,Anyone can give any suggestion?

"10/11/2021, 19:36",Pinky,If you have done. So share your strategy for solving those questions.
"10/11/2021, 19:37",Abhinav,You have to try bro. Initially it was tough for me now I completed 26 assignments.

"11/11/2021, 19:39",Sanket,And technically *W* is same for each time step if we update one all will get update
"11/11/2021, 20:04",Priyanshi,In RNN there is no feedforward. Output is fed as input till it reaches end of input.

"22/11/2021, 18:49",Aadesh,Okay
"22/11/2021, 18:50",Aadesh,So this will be py file or pickle?
"22/11/2021, 18:50",Yogesh,no weights metrics log-loss
"22/11/2021, 18:50",Yogesh,only pickle file
"22/11/2021, 18:50",Aadesh,I think py
"22/11/2021, 18:51",Yogesh,and if you want to improve the latency
"22/11/2021, 18:51",Aadesh,What will go for deployment or production?
"22/11/2021, 18:51",Aadesh,"This if we are running on jupyter ,"
"22/11/2021, 18:52",Aadesh,As per my thoughts...
"22/11/2021, 18:52",Yogesh,then in the case of linear models (logistic or SVM) you deploy weights and if-else condition in tree based models (decision tree- random forest GBDT)
"22/11/2021, 18:52",Yogesh,no py file
"22/11/2021, 18:52",Yogesh,only pickle file
"22/11/2021, 18:52",Yogesh,only pickle file
"22/11/2021, 18:53",Yogesh,you create pickle file through sk-learn
"22/11/2021, 18:53",Yogesh,there is no relation to jupyter notebook
"22/11/2021, 18:54",Aadesh,"Okay... Can please share some reference article,"

"22/11/2021, 18:54",Sherya,pickle file stores all declared variables in your py file in compressed format. For eg: if you create a picke for standard scaler object: it will store the values of mean and standard deviation of feature variable in training set. Then you can use this pickle file to standardize inputs in production by using: (x-mean)/std.
"22/11/2021, 18:55",Yogesh,no only pickle file
"22/11/2021, 18:55",Yogesh,you should have your basics right
"22/11/2021, 18:55",Yogesh,only pickle file

"22/11/2021, 20:34",Rohan,"Hi in text classification with CNN where do we have to use pertained glove vectors. I am not getting it, after tokenizer we can directly pass it to embedding layer. So, why do we need glove vector"
"22/11/2021, 20:42",Priyanshi,In embedding layer there is parameter called as weights. There you have to pass it. You also have to set Trainable= False as you don't want to train these weights.

"27/11/2021, 14:06",Sherya,"There is no generalized answer to this question. If the proportion of missing values is less compared to your data size, you can get rid of them. If this is not true, you need to try multiple imputation techniques and find what gives the best results."

"27/11/2021, 16:49",Shradha,"Actually, it's not numerical data the class is binary categorical of 0 and 1"
"27/11/2021, 16:50",Shradha,So 35 points out of 2000 is 1.75%. I can remove this much na
"27/11/2021, 16:53",Sherya,"1.75% is a large proportion. And your dataset is also small. Try with some imputation techniques: ffill,bfill,mode or use classification technique for imputation. Impute with mode first if it's a categorical variable then try others."
"27/11/2021, 16:57",Shradha,"Okay. Also, this variable is also the class variable that I need to predict so imputing 1.75% of class variable can affect the training? Also it is imbalanced with 1703:262 ratio s imputing with mode can be  a bad idea right?"
"27/11/2021, 17:04",Sherya,Yup mode won't be the right choice for this. Try with classification based imputation.
"27/11/2021, 17:05",Shradha,"Okay, I think imputing with KNN would be the way to go"
